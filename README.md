# AUEB MLCA - Deep Learning Text Classification

We are three ambitious students of the Master of Science in Business Analytics programme at AUEB, who are called upon to complete a text classification problem related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

The main idea is to train a Neural Network with pre-classified data and create an algorithmic model so that, by entering new data, we can achieve the greatest predictability in new and future publications.

The first step, before getting to the analysis, is entering the 'parser_eda_extract' folder and running the parser of the .ipynb file. The original raw data is included in the same folder.  

Then two csv files will be extracted, that you can import to the respective notebooks - one for binary and one for multiclass classification purposes. Notebooks are fully commented, however you can always look at the report for further explanation.

Tip: Run the jupyter notebooks in Google Colab to enhance performance


Enjoy!
