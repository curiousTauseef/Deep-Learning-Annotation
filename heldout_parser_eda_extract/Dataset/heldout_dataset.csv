"Multivariate Granger causality between CO2 emissions, energy consumption, FDI (foreign direct investment) and GDP (gross domestic product): Evidence from a panel of BRIC (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, and China) countries Abstract: This paper addresses the impact of both economic growth and financial development on environmental degradation using a panel cointegration technique for the period between 1980 and 2007, except for Russia (1992–2007). In long-run equilibrium, CO2 emissions appear to be energy consumption elastic and FDI inelastic, and the results seem to support the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The causality results indicate that there exists strong bidirectional causality between emissions and FDI and unidirectional strong causality running from output to FDI. The evidence seems to support the pollution haven and both the halo and scale effects. Therefore, in attracting FDI, developing countries should strictly examine the qualifications for foreign investment or to promote environmental protection through the coordinated know-how and technological transfer with foreign companies to avoid environmental damage. Additionally, there exists strong output-emissions and output-energy consumption bidirectional causality, while there is unidirectional strong causality running from energy consumption to emissions. Overall, the method of managing both energy demand and FDI and increasing both investment in the energy supply and energy efficiency to reduce CO2 emissions and without compromising the country’s competitiveness can be adopted by energy-dependent BRIC countries."
"Clean fuels for resource-poor settings: A systematic review of barriers and enablers to adoption and sustained use Background Access to, and sustained adoption of, clean household fuels at scale remains an aspirational goal to achieve sufficient reductions in household air pollution (HAP) in order to impact on the substantial global health burden caused by reliance on solid fuels. Aim and objectives To systematically appraise the current evidence base to identify: (i) which factors enable or limit adoption and sustained use of clean fuels (namely liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, solar cooking and alcohol fuels) in low- and middle-income countries; (ii) lessons learnt concerning equitable scaling-up of programmes of cleaner cooking fuels in relation to poverty, urban–rural settings and gender. Methods A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted using established review methodology and extensive searches of published and grey literature sources. Data extraction and quality appraisal of quantitative, qualitative and case studies meeting inclusion criteria were conducted using standardised methods with reliability checking. Findings Forty-four studies from Africa, Asia and Latin America met the inclusion criteria (17 on biogas, 12 on LPG, 9 on solar, 6 on alcohol fuels). A broad range of inter-related enabling and limiting factors were identified for all four types of intervention, operating across seven pre-specified domains (i.e. fuel and technology characteristics, household and setting characteristics, knowledge and perceptions, financial, tax and subsidy aspects, market development, regulation, legislation and standards, and programme and policy mechanisms) and multiple levels (i.e. household, community, national). All domains matter and the majority of factors are common to all clean fuels interventions reviewed although some are fuel and technology-specific. All factors should therefore be taken into account and carefully assessed during planning and implementation of any small- and large-scale initiative aiming at promoting clean fuels for household cooking. Conclusions Despite limitations in quantity and quality of the evidence this systematic review provides a useful starting point for the design, delivery and evaluation of programmes to ensure more effective adoption and use of LPG, biogas, alcohol fuels and solar cooking. Funding This review was funded by the Department for International Development (DfID) of the United Kingdom. The authors would also like to thank the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre) for their technical support."
"Adverse health impacts of cooking with kerosene: A multi-country analysis within the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology Study Background Kerosene, which was until recently considered a relatively clean household fuel, is still widely used in low- and middle-income countries for cooking and lighting. However, there is little data on its health effects. We examined cardiorespiratory effects and mortality in households using kerosene as their primary cooking fuel within the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study. Methods We analyzed baseline and follow-up data on 31,490 individuals from 154 communities in China, India, South Africa, and Tanzania where there was at least 10% kerosene use for cooking at baseline. Baseline comorbidities and health outcomes during follow-up (median 9.4 years) were compared between households with kerosene versus clean (gas or electricity) or solid fuel (biomass and coal) use for cooking. Multi-level marginal regression models adjusted for individual, household, and community level covariates. Results Higher rates of prevalent respiratory symptoms (e.g. 34% [95% CI:15–57%] more dyspnea with usual activity, 44% [95% CI: 21–72%] more chronic cough or sputum) and lower lung function (differences in FEV1: −46.3 ml (95% CI: −80.5; −12.1) and FVC: −54.7 ml (95% CI: −93.6; −15.8)) were observed at baseline for kerosene compared to clean fuel users. The odds of hypertension was slightly elevated but no associations were observed for blood pressure. Prospectively, kerosene was associated with elevated risks of all-cause (HR: 1.32 (95% CI: 1.14-1.53)) and cardiovascular (HR: 1.34 (95% CI: 1.00-1.80)) mortality, as well as major fatal and incident non-fatal cardiovascular (HR: 1.34 (95% CI: 1.08-1.66)) and respiratory (HR: 1.55 (95% CI: 0.98-2.43)) diseases, compared to clean fuel use. Further, compared to solid fuel users, those using kerosene had 20–47% higher risks for the above outcomes. Conclusions Kerosene use for cooking was associated with higher rates of baseline respiratory morbidity and increased risk of mortality and cardiorespiratory outcomes during follow-up when compared to either clean or solid fuels. Replacing kerosene with cleaner-burning fuels for cooking is recommended."
"Effect of hydrogen supplementation on engine performance and emissions Abstract:Abstract Vehicular Pollution and environmental degradation are on the rise with increasing vehicles and to stop this strict regulation have been put on vehicular emissions. Also, the depleting fossil fuels are of great concern for energy security. This has motivated the researchers to invest considerable resources in finding cleaner burning, sustainable and renewable fuels. However renewable fuels independently are not sufficient to deal with the problem at hand due to supply constraints. Hence, advanced combustion technologies such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), low-temperature combustion (LTC), and dual fuel engines are extensively researched upon. In this context, this work investigates dual fuel mode combustion using a constant speed diesel engine, operated using hydrogen and diesel. The engine is operated at 25, 50 and 75% loads and substitution of diesel energy with hydrogen energy is done as 0, 5, 10 and 20%. The effect of hydrogen energy share (HES) enhancement on engine performance and emissions is investigated. In the tested range, slightly detrimental effect of HES on brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is observed. Comparision of NO and NO2 emissions is done to understand the non-thermal influence of H2 on the NOx emissions. Hence, HES is found beneficial in reducing harmful emissions at low and mid loads."
"Upcoming Power Crisis in India – Increasing Electricity Demand Abstract: In this world of modernization every country tries to increase their domestic production in order to increase GDP. India is one of them, in order to improve their economy with the help of make in India and similar schemes. In this development process, India is committed to sustainable development and minimal use of conventional energy resources. In order to reduce CO2and CFC emission India started to reduce fossil fuel dependency. It tries to convert their fossil fuel system into regenerative and renewable sources. India begins to install Solar and Wind power plants of huge capacity instead of their conventional thermal and nuclear power plants. With the emergence of new technologies such as Wireless charging systems, Electric Vehicles, Smart systems such as Smart Grid and Wireless Communication systems such as Internet of things (IoT). But here one thing is notable that due to these systems power consumption also increases, due to their heavy power ratings and lower efficiencies in case of Wireless systems (Charging and Communication). In 2018 India is closest to power demand and its supply but not greater or equal to the power demanded. India has announced that power production is surplus in current scenario. But due to introduction of these above systems lead to immense increase in power demand. If India has not taken any effective steps to increase their power production then it will suffers power crisis in upcoming decades. The new power plants have higher efficiencies, high durability and produces almost no emissions. India has considered 8% growth till 2020, but this consideration must have reviewed as soon as possible.In 2018-19 data says that India is 0.9% power deficit which is very good progress in power sector as in past data. But this percentage is going to increase in future. There is also increasing market for Electric Vehicles. Automobile manufacturing companies are trying to shift their production towards Electric Vehicles. Due to their high cost efficiencies, low vibrations as compared to engines, no emissions, less maintenance, Electric Vehicle is becoming popular these days. This ultimately results in tremendous increase in power demand. Mobile manufacturer companies always try to increase power capacity of Mobile Batteries in order to increase its backup and introduce the wireless charging feature. This also results in increase in power consumption. Intelligent home appliances are also introduced, these also consumes more power due to integration of remote control and advanced User Interfaces such as facial recognition. Voice control and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are also integrated to these devices. These systems are designed for higher capacities i.e. parallel processing and high speed processing to enable multitasking features. These systemsrequire more power than conventional systems."
"How do oil prices, macroeconomic factors and policies affect the market for renewable energy? Abstract The aim of this study is to determine the nature of any relationship between renewable energy investment, oil prices, GDP and the interest rate, using a time series approach. We concentrate on three countries with different relationships with the renewable energy sector, with Norway and the UK being oil-exporters for most of the sample and the USA an importer. Following estimation using a VAR model, the results provide evidence of considerable heterogeneity across the countries, with the USA and Norway having a strong relationship between oil prices and renewable energy and the UK no relationship. These results reflect the fact that the USA is predominantly an oil-importer during most of this sample and supports renewable energy relatively less than the other countries, so changes to renewable energy investment reflect other factors in the market such as the price of substitutes to a greater extent than countries where renewable energy receives more government support. Similarly with Norway, where due to its market orientated approach, there is some evidence of the macroeconomy affecting the renewable energy market. The main policy implications from this study are that in countries where there is little support for the renewable energy sector, investment will be more dependent on macroeconomic aspects as well as substitutes such as oil, therefore the authorities will need to potentially increase financial support when oil prices are low or when the economy is in a downturn to ensure investment in RE continues at a constant level."
"A novel renewable energy selection model for United Nations' sustainable development goals Abstract In 2015, the United Nations announced the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to safeguard the earth and end poverty as the new global sustainable development agenda. One of these SDGs, Goal #7, is about affordable and clean energy. Despite the importance, there are few tools that guide policy-makers in aligning their domestic policies with these SDGs. The paper addresses this research gap and introduces a numerical decision-support method for identifying the most suitable renewable energy source (RES). RES selection according to SDGs can be a challenge for decision makers. This article presents an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that is based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) term set. The decision criteria are weighed with HFL Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the most appropriate RES alternative is chosen with the HFL COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) technique. The value of the method is demonstrated on a case from Turkey, and a comparative analysis. This approach constitutes a novelty by proposing a numerical model for SDGs that combines AHP and COPRAS in a HFL environment with group decision-making for the first time. The method can help policy-makers in better structuring local energy policies with regard to global efforts in a developing country setting."
"A comprehensive indicator set for measuring multiple benefits of energy efficiency Abstract In this paper, we develop a quantitative indicator approach including 20 indicators to measure the multiple benefits of energy efficiency (MB-EE). The MB-EEs are classified into three groups: environmental (e.g. energy savings, emissions), economic (e.g. GDP, employment), and social (health, energy poverty) aspects. We explain the methodological approach, the underlying data sources and limitations. The indicator set has been applied to 29 countries (EU28 plus Norway) for the period 2000 to 2015, proving that it allows to conduct in-depth comparisons of developments and differences across Europe. The indicator set also supports the design of well-suited energy policies by allowing to take into account, on an informed basis, more of the multiple impacts of energy efficiency. For example, our analysis of the effect of energy savings for the period 2000 to 2015 in Germany shows GHG savings of about 158 MtCO2eq., about 30,000 avoided deaths due to less air pollution, a reduction of Germany's import dependency by 5.8 percentage points and a growth of GDP by around 0.3% per year for the period 2010 to 2015) as a consequence of improved energy efficiency. To conclude, the presented approach allows to comprehensively and regularly assess policies in terms of their MB-EEs."
"The energy metabolism of countries: Energy efficiency and use in the period that followed the global financial crisis Abstract This paper discusses how the deceleration of economic growth, that followed the financial crisis of 2008, influenced the energy efficiency, allocation and use of 18 European countries. By using a Multi-scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM), the relationships between energy requirements, economic trends and population are investigated for the years 2008 and 2015. The analyses are performed for the entire society (Level N), for the household and the paid sectors (Level N-1) and for the agricultural, the industrial and the service activities (Level N-2). Results show that two main groups of countries performed the largest energy reductions, namely: the country most affected by the global financial crisis, such as Greece, Romania and Spain, where the total energy throughput decreased by −19.6%, −15.8% and −12.1%, respectively; and the countries, such as Ireland and United Kingdom, that experienced the largest energy intensity reductions (−38.7% and −19.2%), together with the highest GDP increases (+44.8% and +10.2%). By providing an overview of the relationships existing between socio-economic and energy variables, this paper contributes to the debate around growth and efficiency and can support the design of policies oriented to promote the achievement of a more sustainable and competitive economy."
"Asymmetric and extreme influence of energy price changes on renewable energy stock performance Abstract Promoting the development of renewable energy has become the key factor to solve the problems of energy and climate change issues. However, its development is largely constrained by the prices of traditional fossil energy. This paper explores the influence of various fossil energy price changes on renewable energy stock returns using a network approach. Specifically, a positive and negative returns network and value-at-risk (VaR) network are constructed separately for identifying the asymmetric and extreme information spillover. Our findings show the fossil energy–renewable energy network system has a relatively high level of interdependence. The electricity market behaves as the major contributor to the changes of renewable energy returns in the returns connectedness network, while oil and coal contribute most to the changes of renewable energy returns in the VaR connectedness network. The dynamic results show that the contributions of fossil energy price changes to renewable energy returns have strong time-varying pattern with high volatility over time. The total connectedness in the positive returns network is slightly stronger than that in the negative returns network for most of the time during our sample period."
"China's renewable energy trade potential in the ""Belt-and-Road"" countries: A gravity model analysis The trade ties between China and the ""Belt-and-Road"" Countries have been developing rapidly since the ""Belt-and-Road Initiative"" was proposed in 2013. Understanding the potential of renewable energy trade products in this region is of great significance for the renewable energy industry. By adopting the gravity model and data of 81 products from 2007 to 2017 across 66 countries, empirical evidence was examined of China's renewable energy product trade potential in the “Belt and Road” countries. The results indicated that: (1) The gross domestic product (GDP) of the “Belt and Road” countries and the total energy consumption of two trading parties were the main factors affecting China's export of renewable energy products; (2) Among the 65 countries along the “Belt and Road”, China had great potentials for exporting renewable energy products in 26 countries, and most of them were in the CIS, Central and Eastern Europe, West Asia, South Asia and Central Asia; and (3) China's trade potentials for renewable energy products had increased year by year during the study period in the 16 countries in Central and Eastern Europe, and experienced ups and downs in other regions. In recent years, China's trade potential in the CIS countries had rebounded significantly."
"Causal interactions between trade openness, renewable electricity consumption, and economic growth in Asia-Pacific countries: Fresh evidence from a bootstrap ARDL approach This paper applies a new bootstrap Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ADL) approach to examine the nexus between trade openness, renewable electricity consumption, and economic growth for seven countries in the Asia-Pacific region during 1980–2017 period. In fact, there is no evidence of cointegration among real trade openness, electricity consumption, and real GDP per capita in countries, with the exception of Malaysia, where real GDP serves as dependent variable. However, cointegration does manifest in the cases of Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand when trade openness is used as the dependent variable. A similar outcome is observed for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand when renewable electricity consumption is used as the dependent variable. A short-run analysis reveals mixed results in term of the direction of the causality among different variables for various countries. Such results have implications for trade, energy, and environmental policies. One implication is that any environmental policy aiming to reduce the use of non-renewable energy and carbon dioxide emissions will inevitably lead to greater renewable energy consumption, which in turn may enhance trade openness and ultimately accelerate economic growth."
"Resistance in rejecting solid fuels: Beyond availability and adoption in the structural dominations of cooking practices in rural India Abstract Solid fuels are the primary cooking fuels in a wide range of developing countries, a situation that is projected to remain for the coming few decades. In the energy poverty scholarship, it is a well-argued concept that social systems influence people’s energy choices. Influenced by theories of Practice, this study explores the role that social structure plays in the perpetuation of the use of solid cooking fuels, with a particular focus on rural India. We employ a qualitative approach of inquiry for data collection in three villages in Chittoor district in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The results presented in this paper are based on in-depth household interviews and focus group discussions. The findings suggest that cooking with solid fuels is intertwined with structural elements, such as established traditions, traditional income generating practices, gender norms, and a sense of belonging. These factors profoundly dominate households’ decisions to continue using solid fuels despite the availability and the adoption of modern alternatives. The paper argues that interventions targeted at reducing the use of solid fuels may fail if they: 1) focus only on supplying modern fuels; 2) do not consider contextual social barriers; and 3) are implemented as standalone projects."
"Attitudes towards domestic violence in 49 low- and middle-income countries: A gendered analysis of prevalence and countrylevel correlates Abstract Background Violence against women by an intimate partner (DV) is a serious public health and human rights issue. Attitudes justifying DV strongly predict its perpetration and victimisation. This paper presents gendered ecological analyses of the societal acceptance of DV in 49 lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) across geographical regions. Methods and findings We utilised data from 49 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2017, United Nations Statistics and topic-specific meta-databases. DV acceptance was measured as the justification of 'wife-beating' in at least one of five circumstances, and by the summative scale. Stepwise multiple linear regression examined country-level social, economic and political empowerment predictors of societal acceptance of DV amongst women, men, and the aggregate gender difference. Women were more likely than men to justify DV in Sub-Saharan Africa and South (east) Asia with societal acceptance of DV being more widespread in these regions compared with Latin America, the Caribbean, Central/ West Asia and Europe. Political conflict and limited economic rights for women were associated with higher levels of DV acceptance amongst women and men. Men in more democratic countries were less likely to justify DV. Amongst women, higher national female literacy rates predicted lower levels of justification. There were higher levels of DV acceptance amongst women and a wider aggregate gender difference in countries with a larger representation of women in national parliament. Conclusion Justification of DV is widespread amongst women and men in LMICs with acceptance rates varying across countries and regions. Gender differences in the impact of contextual factors on DV acceptance supports a gendered approach to national-level interventions. Our findings highlight the need for tailored interventions targeting DV acceptance in conflict-impacted societies. The emphasis of inter(national) policies on the 'empowerment' domains of widely-used gender (in)equality indices need to be coupled with strategies tackling discriminatory gender norms."
"Traditional Mechanism to Eliminate Violence against Women: A Perspective from Nigeria Different points of view have been projected by scholars with regard to the role culture and religious beliefs play when it comes to women empowerment against cultural traditions that are not constructive. Many of these practices, defended in the name of tradition, that impinge on human rights are gender specific; they preserve patriarchy at the expense of women’s rights. The girl child often faces discrimination from the earliest stages of life, through childhood and into adulthood. These cultural traditions among others are responsible for the physical and psychological underdevelopment of women and the girl-child and that in turn affects their input in the development of their nation. There are catalogue of traditional practices in Nigeria which include, girl-child marriages, educational backwardness, widowhood rituals, spousal abuse, irresponsible divorce, male-child preference, female circumcision among others. The need to transform cultural beliefs that perpetuate violence against women can never be over emphasized. These practices constitute violence against women and as such must be treated as a national crisis. There can be no justice, development nor democracy if violence against women is seen accepted. The paper’s aim is to seek ways of utilizing tradition (religion and culture) in achieving women’s equality and empowerment as stated in UN Sustainable Development Goal. Hence, the paper reviews the challenges of traditional practices and examines the possibilities available for women empowerment by utilising religious and positive cultural practices. This is done through eliminating traditional practices detrimental to female empowerment while the positive elements of the tradition are retained."
"Gender equality as a means to women empowerment? Consensus, challenges and prospects for post-2015 development agenda in Africa Abstract In this paper, we have examined gender equality and women’s empowerment (GEWE) as reflected in the millennium development goals (MDGs) as well as the conceptualization and localization of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The paper adopts Amartya Sen’s women agency conceptual framework to advance the thesis of this article that while there is general consensus on achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment, the MDGs adopted in 2001 fell far short of fulfilling this consensus and that the incoming SDGs must respond to fundamental issues of GEWE from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. This paper addresses the issues of conceptualization, context, and design of MDGs and how lessons learnt in its implementation inform SDGs. The question is, will GEWE maintain any pride of place? Analysis in the paper reveals that qualitative indicators such as human rights, equity, and capabilities were silent in the MDG design, constructs, and implementation. The paper suggests that the understanding and putting in place of mechanisms for continuous assessment of the human-centered indicators, such as quality of life, as part of the SDGs’ localization efforts portend increasing effectiveness of SDGs toward addressing gender-sensitive issues of social exclusion, inequality, and resource distribution, which have a great bearing on sustainable development."
"Digital Workplace Implementation To Promote Gender Equality Abstract—The  focus  of  this  research  is  to  provide  an explanation  of  how the  digital  workplace  can help  to  promote gender equality in the organization.

"Sexual relationship power and malnutrition among HIV-positive women in rural uganda Abstract Inequality within partner relationships is associated with HIV acquisition and gender violence, but little is known about more pervasive effects on women's health. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of associations between sexual relationship power and nutritional status among women in Uganda. Participants completed questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. We assessed sexual relationship power using the Sexual Relationship Power Scale (SRPS). We performed logistic regression to test for associations between sexual relationship power and poor nutritional status including body mass index, body fat percentage, and mid-upper arm circumference. Women with higher sexual relationship power scores had decreased odds of low body mass index (OR 0.29, p = 0.01), low body fat percentage (OR 0.54, p = 0.04), and low mid-upper arm circumference (OR 0.22, p = 0.01). These relationships persisted in multivariable models adjusted for potential confounders. Targeted interventions to improve intimate partner relationship equality should be explored to improve health status among women living with HIV in rural Africa."
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Women Action, was intended to be ground-breaking for gender equality. Instead, with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic even the limited gains made in the past decades are at risk of being rolled back. The pandemic is deepening pre-existing inequalities, exposing vulnerabilities in social, political and economic systems which are in turn amplifying the impacts of the pandemic. Across every sphere, from health to the economy, security to social protection, the impacts of COVID-19 are exacerbated for women and girls simply by virtue of their sex: > Compounded economic impacts are felt especially by women and girls who are generally earning less, saving less, and holding insecure jobs or living close to poverty. > While early reports reveal more men are dying as a result of COVID-19, the health of women generally is adversely impacted through the reallocation of resources and priorities, including sexual and reproductive health services. > Unpaid care work has increased, with children out-of-school, heightened care needs of older persons and overwhelmed health services."
"Associations of women's empowerment with neonatal, infant and under-5 mortality in low-and /middle-income countries: meta-analysis of individual participant data from 59 countries Background Child survival and women's empowerment are global public health concerns and important sustainable development goals (SDGs). Low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) have the largest burden of both phenomena. The aim of this study is to investigate a measure of women's empowerment at individual and population levels and its potential associations with neonatal, infant and under-5 mortality at national and regional levels in 59 LMICs. Methods We used pooled population-based cross-sectional surveys from 59 LMICs (n=6 12 529) conducted from 2000 to 2015 using standardised protocols. We constructed individual-level women's empowerment index (ILWEI) and population-level women's empowerment index (PLWEI) for LMICs and investigated the potential associations of these measures with neonatal, infant and under-5 mortality using two-stage random-effect individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. Results The pooled neonatal mortality rate was 24 per 1000 live births. Infant and under-5 mortality rates were 43 and 55/1000 live births, respectively. In the pooled sample, 61.6% and 19.9% of women had autonomy regarding their healthcare and household decision-making, respectively, whereas 56.0% rejected domestic violence against women for any reason. IPD meta-analysis showed that children of women with low ILWEI had a higher risk of neonatal (OR: 1.18, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.22), infant (OR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.17) and under-5 (OR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.18) mortality compared with children of high ILWEI. Similar relationships were found across most of the regions as well as between PLWEI and all the three outcomes. Conclusions Women's empowerment at individual and population levels is associated with neonatal, infant and under-5 mortality in LMICs. Our study underscores the importance of women's empowerment in accelerating progress towards the attainment of the SDG targets for child survival in LMICs. Multi-sectoral and concerted efforts are necessary to eliminate preventable child mortality in these countries."
"Key points for abolishing Female Genital Mutilation from the perspective of the men involved. ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION female Genital Mutilation is internationally considered an affront on human rights and an act of violence against women and young girls. Furthermore, it hierarchises and perpetuates inequality and denies the right to bodily and psychosocial integrity of women and young girls. AIMS to detect the key points for the abolition of Female Genital Mutilation as well as the necessary resources for its eradication. MATERIAL AND METHOD a qualitative methodology with an ethnonursing perspective, via semi-structured interviews, held both individually and in groups, in 21 men familiar with Female Genital Mutilation. FINDINGS through the voices of men familiar with this tradition, five key points are presented for its gradual eradication: sensitisation and awareness building, team action, abolition-promoting media, focusing action on rural areas and applying educational means before punitive ones. CONCLUSION AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS awareness-raising via the combined efforts of families, communities and governments, together with the promotion of health education programmes in demonstrating the complications derived from this practice, play a vital part in eradicating Female Genital Mutilation"
"﻿REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN CHILD MARRIAGE IN BANGLADESH. This study aimed to investigate the regional variations in the prevalence of child marriage in Bangladesh with a view to providing recommendations for division-specific policy interventions. Data from the 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Substantial regional variations in child marriage were found in Bangladesh. Rangpur and Khulna had more than four times higher odds of child marriage than Sylhet (4.57 and 4.11 times, respectively). Barisal and Rajshahi had more than three times higher odds of child marriage than Sylhet (3.70 and 3.48 times, respectively). Chittagong and Dhaka had about two times odds of child marriage than Sylhet (1.98 and 2.67 times, respectively), even after controlling for selected socio-demographic, economic and cultural characteristics. Respondent's education, employment status, husband's education and wealth index were inversely associated with the prevalence of child marriage. The policy implications of these findings are discussed in the context of Bangladesh."
"﻿Management of painful clitoral neuroma after female genital mutilation/cutting BackgroundTraumatic neuromas are the result of regenerative disorganized proliferation of the proximal portion of lesioned nerves. They can exist in any anatomical site and are responsible for neuropathic pain. Post-traumatic neuromas of the clitoris have been described as an uncommon consequence of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). FGM/C involves partial or total removal of the female genital organs for non-therapeutic reasons. It can involve cutting of the clitoris and can cause psychological, sexual, and physical complications. We aimed to evaluate the symptoms and management of women presenting with a clitoral neuroma after female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C).MethodsWe identified women who attended our specialized clinic for women with FGM/C who were diagnosed with a traumatic neuroma of the clitoris between April 1, 2010 and June 30, 2016. We reviewed their medical files and collected socio-demographic, clinical, surgical, and histopathological information.ResultsSeven women were diagnosed with clitoral neuroma. Six attended our clinic to undergo clitoral reconstruction, and three of these suffered from clitoral pain. The peri-clitoral fibrosis was removed during clitoral reconstruction, which revealed neuroma of the clitoris in all six subjects. Pain was ameliorated after surgery.The seventh woman presented with a visible and palpable painful clitoral mass diagnosed as a neuroma. Excision of the mass ameliorated the pain.Sexual function improved in five women. One was not sexually active, and one had not yet resumed sex.ConclusionPost-traumatic clitoral neuroma can be a consequence of FGM/C. It can cause clitoral pain or be asymptomatic. In the case of pain symptoms, effective treatment is neuroma surgical excision, which can be performed during clitoral reconstruction. Surgery should be considered as part of multidisciplinary care. The efficacy of neuroma excision alone or during clitoral reconstruction to treat clitoral pain should be further assessed among symptomatic women."
"The role of men in abandonment of female genital mutilation: a systematic review ABSTRACT BackgroundMen in their roles as fathers, husbands, community and religious leaders may play a pivotal part in the continuation of female genital mutilation (FGM). However, the research on their views of FGM and their potential role in its abandonment are not well described.MethodsWe undertook a systematic review of all publications between 2004 and 2014 that explored mens attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours in regards to FGM, as well as their ideas about FGM prevention and abandonment.ResultsWe included twenty peer-reviewed articles from 15 countries in the analysis. Analysis revealed ambiguity of mens wishes in regards to the continuation of FGM. Many men wished to abandon this practice because of the physical and psychosexual complications to both women and men. Social obligation and the silent culture between the sexes were posited as major obstacles for change. Support for abandonment was influenced by notions of social obligation, religion, education, ethnicity, urban living, migration, and understanding of the negative sequelae of FGM. The strongest influence was education.ConclusionThe level of education of men was one of the most important indicators for mens support for abandonment of FGM. Social obligation and the lack of dialogue between men and women were two key issues that men acknowledged as barriers to abandonment. Advocacy by men and collaboration between men and womens health and community programs may be important steps forward in the abandonment process."
"﻿The impact of physical, psychological, and sexual intimate male partner violence on women's mental health: depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder, state anxiety, and suicide. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the impact of lifetime physical, psychological, and sexual intimate male partner violence (IPV) on the mental health of women, after controlling for the contribution of lifetime victimization. The comorbidity of depressive symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their relation to state anxiety and suicide were also assessed. METHODS Physically/psychologically (n = 75) and psychologically abused women (n = 55) were compared with nonabused control women (n = 52). Information about sociodemographic characteristics, lifetime victimization, and mental health status (depressive and state anxiety symptoms, PTSD, and suicide) was obtained through face-to-face structured interviews. RESULTS Women exposed to physical/psychological and psychological IPV had a higher incidence and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, PTSD, and thoughts of suicide than control women, with no differences between the two abused groups. The concomitance of sexual violence was associated with a higher severity of depressive symptoms in both abused groups and a higher incidence of suicide attempts in the physically/psychologically abused group. The incidence of PTSD alone was very rare, and depressive symptoms were either alone or comorbid with PTSD. The severity of state anxiety was higher in abused women with depressive symptoms or comorbidity, as was the incidence of suicidal thoughts in the physically/psychologically abused group. Lifetime victimization was not a predictor of the deterioration of mental health in this study. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that psychological IPV is as detrimental as physical IPV, with the exception of effects on suicidality, which emphasizes that psychological IPV should be considered a major type of violence by all professionals involved."
"﻿Pattern of Exploitation and Organised Crime: Study on Homeless Beggars in Patna, Bihar Homelessness has been one of the issues that remain unresolved in parts of India due to complicated and interwoven factors. Human rights groups have also found that in India children are sometimes forced into pornography, prostitution and sex slavery. The purpose of the study is to find out the pattern of exploitation and victimization of the beggar population in Patna district. The study is qualitative and exploratory in nature. Purposive sampling was used to conduct this study with 22 beggars including female and male beggars aged between 13 to 55. The study reveals that homeless beggars are victims of organized crimes and face exploitation such as physical torture and economic loss. Female beggars face sexual exploitation and are manipulated into prostitution. Young beggars are manipulated and forced into drug abuse and drug dealing, pick pocketing, stealing and robbery. With no doubt, the illegal activities are being operated by gangs & supported by local police. Homeless beggars are being targeted and continuously exploited by gangs especially young girls & children. State needs to take immediate steps to prevent these vulnerable populations from being victimized being homeless. The study is conducted at specific places where beggars‟ daily activities are centralized with consequence that the findings are potentially very context specific. Index TermHomeless, Beggars, Exploitation, Victim, Prostitution."
"﻿THE CORRELATION BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE OF MARRIAGEABLE AGE, EDUCATION, MATCHMAKING AND CHILD MARRIAGE IN FEMALES IN BANJARNEGARA INDONESIA Background : Teenage marriage is still found in developing countries, including Indonesia. The percentage of teenage marriage in females in Indonesia is 11.5%. Various factors related to teenage marriage are education, knowledge, economy, and culture. Impacts caused by teenage marriages include pregnancy in adolescence which results in increased maternal and infant deaths, dropouts, and poor quality of the family. The prevalence of teenage marriage in Banjarnegara in 2016 was 23%, higher than the national prevalence. Objective : This study aims to determine the correlation between factors related to knowledge of marriageable age, education, matchmaking and child marriage in females in Banjarnegara Indonesia. Methods : This was a correlational cross sectional study. There were 96 respondents selected using proportionated stratified random sampling Chi square and logistic regression were used for data analysis. Results : Findings show that there were statistically significant correlations between knowledge of marriageable age, education and child marriage. There was no signifciant relationship between matchmaking and child marriage, Respondents with low knowledge were 0.5 times more likely to have child marriage compared with those with high knowledge (p = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.320-0.782). Conclusion : Knowledge of marriageable age is cosidered as the dominant factor affecting child marriage in Banjarnegara Indonesia. It is suggested that health care providers should continuously promote about the impact of child marriage to increase the knowledge of marriageable age."
"﻿Perception and attitude of pregnant women in a rural community north-west Nigeria to female genital mutilation Purpose Nigeria has the highest absolute number of residents who have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) and most are carried out during infancy; however most reports on FGM are from urban based facilities hence we sought to know the perception and attitude of pregnant women residing in a rural community in northern Nigeria to FGM.MethodsA descriptive cross sectional study utilized a pretested structured interviewer administered questionnaire to assess the types of FGM known, reasons for performing it and willingness to support or perform FGM among 323 pregnant women attending antenatal care in two different health facilities.ResultsOf the 323 respondents, 256 (79.3 %) were aware of the practice and the common varieties of FGM known to them were Gishiri cut in 137 (53.5 %) and Angurya cut 113 (44.1). The notable reasons for carrying out FGM in the community were tradition 88 (34.4 %), to ease difficulty in childbirth 69 (26.9 %) and better marriage prospect in 55 (21.5 %). Of the respondents that were aware of FGM; 100 (39.1 %) have experienced it and 55 (21.5 %) of those aware of it would subject their daughters to the procedure. There was statistically significant association between willingness to mutilate daughters by the respondents type of education (p = 0.014) and the type of facility they were receiving antenatal care (p = 0.001).ConclusionFGM is prevalent in this community with Gishiri cut being the commonest variety. It is often associated with difficult childbirth and many women would subject their daughters to this practice. Female education and empowerment is crucial to discontinuation of this practice. LESS"
"﻿Knowledge and Attitude of Secondary School Students toward Female Genital Mutilation in Khartoum State, Sudan Background: Female genital mutilation is a deeply rooted harmful practice in Sudan. Objective: This study aims to assess the knowledge and attitude of secondary school students toward Female Genital Mutilation. Methods: A school-based, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Karary Locality, Khartoum State, Sudan. Four secondary schools for girls were involved in the study. From each school, two second grade classes were randomly selected, and data were collected from all students (292) in these two classes using an author-designed questionnaire. Results: The students were between 14 to 19 years old. Most of them (61.3%) were not circumcised. Regarding students’ knowledge about female genital mutilation types, 23.6% of them knew type 1 and 21.2% knew type 4. On the other hand, only 15.1% and 8.6% knew type 2 and 3, respectively. The majority of the students knew that bleeding, delivery problems and recurrent infections are possible female genital mutilation complications. Additionally, 78.8% of the student thought that circumcision should be stopped, and 70.9% of them would disagree if one of the families wants to circumcise a girl. Furthermore, 74.3% would advise their family members not to practice circumcision, and 68.8% agreed to join activities that aim to stop female genital mutilation. In fact, 68.8% perceive female genital mutilation as a violation to human rights, and 76.0% encourage legislations that fight female genital mutilation. Last of all, 79.8% of the students will not circumcise their daughters. Conclusion: The majority of the students showed good knowledge about female genital mutilation complications. While, minority of them knew its types. Moreover, respondents showed a good attitude toward stopping female genital mutilation."
"﻿Urogenital complications among girls with genital mutilation: a hospital-based study in Khartoum. To explore paediatric complications of female genital mutilation (FGM), 255 consecutive girls aged 4-9 years presenting to an emergency ward in Sudan were included in this clinical study. Full examination, including inspection of genitalia, was performed. Dipsticks for nitrite and leucocytes were used to diagnose suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). Girls with a form of FGM narrowing vulva had significantly more UTI than others, and among girls below the age of seven there was a significant association between FGM and UTI. Only 8% of girls diagnosed as having UTI reported urogenital symptoms. In spite of the fact that 73% of the girls subjected to FGM were reported to have been bedridden for one week or more after the operation, only 10% stated immediate complications. We conclude that FGM contributes significantly to morbidity among girls, a large share of which does not come to medical attention."
"﻿Domestic Violence Against Married Women in Cambodia We evaluate the effects of marital resources and early-life experiences on recent domestic violence and attitudes about wife abuse among 2,074 married Cambodian women. Household standard of living was negatively associated with physical domestic violence. Women with 8-13 fewer years of schooling than their husbands more often experienced physical and psychological domestic violence. Women with more living children more often experienced physical domestic violence and justified wife beating. Having surviving parents and siblings was not associated with domestic violence nor with attitudes about wife beating. Women reporting higher paternal schooling, urban childhood residence and domestic violence against their mothers had higher odds of experiencing physical and psychological domestic violence. Findings underscore the effects of marital resources and early-life experiences on domestic violence in Cambodia."
"﻿Sexual violence against women living with or at risk for HIV infection. OBJECTIVES This study investigates factors associated with sexual violence against adult women living with and at risk for HIV infection. METHODS Women at least 18 years old and living in Rhode Island or southeast Massachusetts enrolled from 1987 to 1992 in a cohort study of heterosexual HIV risk. A total of 408 women provided interviews on lifetime experiences of rape and HIV-related risk exposures. Data are presented on 96 women reporting experiences with rape as adults, and 231 women who reported never experiencing rape or forced sex. RESULTS Lifetime prevalence of sexual abuse was 43%. Over half occurred during adulthood. Thirty-five percent of women with HIV were raped as adults. Among women with HIV, adult rape experiences were associated with earlier age of first sex, more sexual partners, unprotected sex involving drugs, earlier age of injection drug use, teen pregnancy, STDs, and serious gynecologic surgery than those reporting they were never raped (prevalence odds ratios ranged from 2.8 to 11.2). Among women without HIV, adult rape was associated with similar experiences, although with some exception, the relative odds estimates were less pronounced. Women engaged in sex work were more likely to report rape. CONCLUSION The high prevalence of rape reported in this cohort of mostly economically poor women living with and at risk for HIV infection is consistent with other studies. Economic and social vulnerability that frames HIV risk and subsequent infection in women includes rape. Clinicians caring for women with HIV and counseling women at risk for infection need to screen routinely for sexual abuse."
"﻿Eradicating female genital mutilation and cutting in Tanzania: an observational study BackgroundFemale genital mutilation and cutting (FGM/C) has long been practiced in various parts of the world. The practice is still prevalent in 29 countries on the African continent despite decades of campaigning to eradicate it. The approaches for eradication have been multi-pronged, including but not limited to, health risk campaigns teaching about the health consequences for the girls and the women, recruitment of change agents from within the communities and the enforcement of legal mechanisms.The purpose of this study was to analyse the impact of an 18 month long campaign to eradicate or reduce FGM/C in a rural predominantly Masai community.MethodsAn observational study involving mixed methods, quantitative and qualitative was conducted in Arusha region, Tanzania. A household survey, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, school children's group discussions and project document reviews for both baseline and endline assessments were used. Same tools were used for both baseline and endline assessements. Comparison of baseline and endline findings and conclusions were drawn.ResultsThe prevalence of self reported FGM/C at endline was 69.2 %. However, physical obstetric examination of women in labour revealed a prevalence of over 95 % FGM/C among women in labour.Those in favour of FGM/C eradication were 88 %. Nearly a third of the 100 FGM practitioners had denounced the practice; they also formed a peer group that met regularly comparing baseline and endline. Knowledge about FGM/C health risks increased from 16 to 30 % (p < 0.001). The practice is currently done secretly to an uncertain extent.ConclusionThis multifaceted educational campaign achieved moderate success in increasing knowledge of the health risks and changing attitudes despite a short period of intervention. However, its effectiveness in reducing FGM/C prevalence was uncertain."
"﻿Girls’ Education and Child Marriage in West and Central Africa: Trends, Impacts, Costs, and Solutions* Abstract Within the context of women’s lack of empowerment, the issues of child marriage and low educational attainment for girls are prominent, especially in West and Central Africa. Using survey data for 21 of the 25 countries in West and Central Africa, this article analyzes trends over time in educational attainment for girls and child marriage. Over the last two and a half decades, not accounting for differences in population sizes between countries, according to the latest DHS and MICS surveys available in each country, completion rates increased on average by 24 points, 14 points, and 8 points at the primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels, respectively. The prevalence of child marriage decreased by about 8 points over that period. Clearly, progress at the secondary level has been weaker than at the primary level, probably in part due to the persistence of high rates of child marriage in many countries. The article suggests that ending child marriage should improve girls’ educational attainment, and conversely, improving girls’ educational attainment should help reduce child marriage. This, in turn, could have major impacts toward contributing to empowering women more broadly. A review of impact evaluations for pilot interventions suggests how ending child marriage and improving educational attainment for girls could be done, with potentially large economic benefits not only for girls and their future household, but also for the region as a whole"
"﻿Effects of female genital mutilation on birth outcomes in Switzerland. OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this study was to determine the desires and wishes of pregnant patients vis-à-vis their external genital anatomy after female genital mutilation (FGM) in the context of antenatal care and delivery in a teaching hospital setting in Switzerland. Our secondary aim was to determine whether women with FGM and non-mutilated women have different fetal and maternal outcomes. DESIGN A retrospective case-control study. SETTING A teaching hospital. POPULATION One hundred and twenty-two patients after FGM who gave consent to participate in this study and who delivered in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the University Hospital of Berne and 110 controls. METHODS Data for patients' wishes concerning their FGM management, their satisfaction with the postpartum outcome and intrapartum and postpartum maternal and fetal data. As a control group, we used a group of pregnant women without FGM who delivered at the same time and who were matched for maternal age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patients' satisfaction after delivery and defibulation after FGM, maternal and fetal delivery data and postpartum outcome measures. RESULTS Six percent of patients wished to have their FGM defibulated antenatally, 43% requested a defibulation during labour, 34% desired a defibulation during labour only if considered necessary by the medical staff and 17% were unable to express their expectations. There were no differences for FGM patients and controls regarding fetal outcome, maternal blood loss or duration of delivery. FGM patients had significantly more often an emergency Caesarean section and third-degree vaginal tears, and significantly less first-degree and second-degree tears. CONCLUSION An interdisciplinary approach may support optimal antenatal and intrapartum management and also the prevention of FGM in newborn daughters."
"Title: Measuring the well-being of health care professionals in the Punjab: a psychometric evaluation of the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale in a Pakistani populatio Background. There is growing awareness of the public health importance of mental well-being both in the general population and in specific groups. The well-being of health professionals is likely to influence the quality of the care they deliver. This study was carried out to examine the well-being of Pakistani healthcare professionals, and to evaluate the psychometric performance of the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) in this population. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was carried out from June, 2013 to December, 2014 among 1,271 Pakistani health care providers (HCPs) working in seven different cities in Punjab province, Pakistan, to examine the acceptability, internal consistency, test-retest reliability and content and construct validity of the English version of the WEMWBS in a Pakistani population sample. All data were analyzed in SPSS v. 21. Results. Our analysis demonstrated unidimensional construct validity, high internal consistency (0.89) and test-retest reliability, good validity and easy readability of WEMWBS in our sample of Pakistani HCPs. The mean WEMWBS score was 48.1 (SD 9.4), which is lower than in the general population in other countries. Male HCPs scored significantly higher on the WEMWBS than their female counterparts (P < 0.05), and older respondents had higher scores. Conclusion. The WEMWBS appears acceptable for use in Pakistani HCPs, and findings from this study verify its validity and internal consistency for this population sample. Our respondents had lower well-being scores than those reported in general population surveys in the UK."
"Title: The neglected millions: the global state of aquaculture workers' occupational safety, health and well-being Abstract A scoping project was funded by the Food and Agriculture Organization in 2017 on the health and safety of aquaculture workers. This project developed a template covering basic types of aquaculture production, health and safety hazards and risks, and related data on injuries and occupational ill health, regulations, social welfare conditions, and labour and industry activity in the sector. Profiles using the template were then produced for key aquaculture regions and nations across the globe where information could be obtained. These revealed both the scale and depth of occupational safety and health (OSH) challenges in terms of data gaps, a lack of or poor risk assessment and management, inadequate monitoring and regulation, and limited information generally about aquaculture OSH. Risks are especially high for offshore/marine aquaculture workers. Good practice as well as barriers to improving aquaculture OSH were noted. The findings from the profiles were brought together in an analysis of current knowledge on injury and work-related ill health, standards and regulation, non-work socioeconomic factors affecting aquaculture OSH, and the role of labour and industry in dealing with aquaculture OSH challenges. Some examples of governmental and labour, industry and non-governmental organisation good practice were identified. Some databases on injury and disease in the sector and research initiatives that solved problems were noted. However, there are many challenges especially in rural and remote areas across Asia but also in the northern hemisphere that need to be addressed. Action now is possible based on the knowledge available, with further research an important but secondary objective."
"Title: The Everyday Feeling Questionnaire: the structure and validation of a measure of general psychological well-being and distress Background: Psychological distress and well-being underlie the continuum of susceptibility to common mental disorders. Our objective was to provide a simple and acceptable measure of psychological distress and well-being to collect information from subjects and informants in non-clinical samples, to explore its internal structure, concurrent and external validity. Method: Self and partner versions of the ten-item Everyday Feeling Questionnaire (EFQ) were administered to 5,279 adults. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to establish concurrent validity. Socioeconomic status, child psychopathology, and family functioning served as external validators. Results: The EFQ was internally consistent with all items loading strongly on a single common factor. Item response analysis showed excellent sensitivity of the ten items, balanced contribution of well-being and distress items and good information content across a broad range. The internal structure of partner version did not differ from self-report. The constructs measured by the EFQ and GHQ were distinct, but highly correlated. The EFQ’s correlations with external validators were stronger than GHQ’s ones. Conclusion: Psychological well-being and distress are measurable as a single construct, using the EFQ. The partner-report version will facilitate the collection of data on multiple household members or on the same individual from two or more sources."
"Title: Mental health and well-being concerns of fly-in fly-out workers and their partners in Australia: a qualitative study Abstract Objectives: Fly-in fly-out (FIFO) work involves commuting long distances to the worksite and living in provided accommodation for 1-4 weeks while on shift. While the potentially detrimental impact of FIFO work on the health and well-being of workers has been documented, little attention has been paid to how workers, or their partners, cope with this impact. This study sought to investigate how workers and their partners negotiate the impact of FIFO on their mental health and well-being. Design: The study design was qualitative. FIFO workers and partners responded to open-ended questions on concerns about the FIFO lifestyle and the support they use. Setting: Australian FIFO workers and partners responded to the questions via email. Participants: Participants were 34 FIFO workers (25 men, M age=41 years) and 26 partners of FIFO workers (26 women, M age=40 years). Results: Participant-validated thematic analysis generated three main themes: managing multiple roles, impact on mental health and well-being, and social support needs. Results revealed difficulties in adjusting between the responsibilities of perceptually distinct on-shift and off-shift lives, and managing potential psychological distance that develops while workers are on site. Participants emphasised the importance of maintaining quality communication and support from family members. Workers and partners attempted to maintain mental health and well-being by regularly engaging with support networks, although many felt organisational support was tokenistic, stigmatised or lacking. Conclusions: Recommendations for enhancing support provided by FIFO organisations are offered. In particular, organisations should emphasise the importance of good mental health and well-being, maintain transparency regarding potential challenges of FIFO lifestyles, and offer professional support for managing multiple social roles and effective communication.

"A retrospective study on the unseen epidemic of road traffic injuries and deaths due to accidents in Mwanza City - Tanzania. Backgrounds: Sixty percent of the global deaths and injuries occur in the developing world and mostly are due to Road traffic accidents (RTAs. looking at the etiological related factors which include, carelessness of the driver, condition of the vehicle or motorcycle, poor condition of roads, risky behavior of the driver, most of these factors can be prevented to some extent. This study therefore, determined the pattern of cases and deaths due to traffic road accidents in Mwanza City Tanzania. Methods: In this retrospective study, records, registers and case notes In the surgical ward and causality, medical records and central police station from 2008 to 2011 were used. The study focused on the two referral hospitals (Sekouture regional hospital and Bugando Medical Center). Results: There were 3450 cases due to accidents reported at both centers (Sekouture regional hospital and Bugando Medical Center of which 3224 (93.4%) had complete information for analysis. 2225 (69%) were male and 999 (31%) were female, and the most affected group were male. Among the RTAs2809 cases (87%) were due to motor cycle accidents which were the leading cause of RTAs with case fatality rate of 5% while motor vehicle has case fatality rate of 24% which is 5 times that of motor cycle. Conclusion and recommendation: Among all RTAs the leading cause of injuries is Motor cycle traffic accidents followed by motor vehicle. RTAs are on increase particularly the motor cycle traffic accidents and has claimed a good number of innocent people's lives however most of them are preventable, therefore driving course to be introduced to motor cycle drivers with emphasize on the road posters signal, rules and regular checkup of their motor cycles especially commercial motor cycle."
"Title: Safety, Health, and Well-Being of Municipal Utility and Construction Workers Objective: To provide a baseline description of psychosocial workplace stressors and supports along with safety, injury, health, and well-being indicators in a sample of utility and construction workers for a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health–funded Total Worker Health™ intervention study. Methods: Survey responses and health assessments were collected from a total of 349 employees in two municipal utility departments. Results: Participants demonstrated poor weight control and body mass index and provided reports of frequent poor health habits, injury, and pain. Although safety climate was good, less desirable levels of psychosocial workplace stressors and supports were observed. These stressors and supports were found to relate with many of the health, injury, and pain indicators. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the need for workplace interventions to promote and protect construction worker health and the importance of the psychosocial work environment."
"Title: Measuring physical and mental health during pregnancy and postpartum in an Australian childbearing population - validation of the PROMIS Global Short Form Abstract Background: Health related quality of life is a critical concept during the perinatal period but remains under-researched. The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement have included the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Global Short Form (GSF) in their core outcome set for pregnancy and childbirth to measure health related quality of life. The PROMIS GSF has not been fully evaluated as a valid and reliable instrument in this population. This study assessed the psychometric properties of the PROMIS GSF during pregnancy and postpartum period. Methods: PROMIS GSF was administered to a sample of 309 pregnant women at four time-points during pregnancy (≤ 27 and 36-weeks) and postpartum (6- and 26-weeks). The structural validity, internal consistency reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness of the PROMIS GSF were evaluated. The internal structure of the PROMIS GSF was explored using Rasch Measurement Theory. Response format, item fit, differential item functioning (item bias), dimensionality of the scale and its targeting were assessed. Results: Two revised subscales (Mental Health: four items; and Physical Health: five items) showed good fit to the Rasch model. The revised mental health subscale demonstrated good internal consistency reliability during pregnancy and postpartum period (α = .88 and .87, respectively). The internal consistency reliability of the physical health subscale was adequate (α = .76 and .75, respectively). The revised mental health subscale was sensitive to group differences according to a history of mental health disorder, income, smoking status, drug use, stress levels and planned versus unplanned pregnancy. Differences in scores on the revised physical subscale were detected for groups based on obesity, income, drug use, smoking status, stress, and history of mental health disorders. Scores on both subscales recorded significant changes across the four time-points, spanning pregnancy and postpartum period. Conclusions: The revised version of the PROMIS GSF was better able to measure mental and physical health during pregnancy and postpartum period compared to the original version. Findings support the clinical and research application of the PROMIS GSF within the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement Standard Set of Outcome Measures for Pregnancy and Childbirth. Ongoing psychometric analysis of the PROMIS GSF is recommended in other maternity populations.

"Importance of community engagement in primary health care: the case of Afghan refugees. Refugees can experience problems accessing and utilising Australian primary health care services, resulting in suboptimal health outcomes. Little is known about the impact of their pre-migration health care experiences. This paper demonstrates how the Afghan pre-migration experiences of primary health care can affect engagement with Australian primary care services. It considers the implications for Australian primary health care policy, planning and delivery. This paper is based on the international experiences, insights and expert opinions of the authors, and is underpinned by literature on Afghan health-seeking behaviour. Importantly, Afghanistan and Australia have different primary health care strategies. In Afghanistan, health care is predominantly provided through a community-based outreach approach, namely through community health workers residing in the local community. In contrast, the Australian health care system requires client attendance at formal health service facilities. This difference contributes to service access and utilisation problems. Community engagement is essential to bridge the gap between the Afghan community and Australian primary health care services. This can be achieved through the health sector working to strengthen partnerships between Afghan individuals, communities and health services. Enhanced community engagement has the potential to improve the delivery of primary health care to the Afghan community in Australia."
"Road traffic injuries in Poland: magnitude and risk factors. Introduction: The article presents the epidemiology of road traffic injuries and fatalities in Poland in the years 2004-2014. In Poland, every fourth death caused by external reasons is the result of a road traffic crash and Poland has one of the highest road fatality rates in relation to vehicle ownership in Europe, with an average 23 deaths per million residents. This rate is two times higher than most other European Union countries. Materials and methods: The research is based on a secondary analysis of data contained in multiple Polish governmental reports, including those of the Prevention and Analysis Office of Road Traffic Headquarters of Police, National Road Safety Program-GAMBIT 2005, National Road Safety Program 2013 to 2020, and Strategy for Efficient State in 2020, plus previous publications describing road safety in Poland. Data were analysed in two steps. First, the data were described using means and frequencies, and tabulated according to variables. Second, we considered the time frame (day, month, and year of the occurrence), the place and the circumstances of fatal road crashes, the kind of event, and types of road crashes. Results: Between 2004 and 2014, there were 475,591 traffic crashes on Polish roads. 52,217 people were killed and 597,191 people were injured. Traffic-related injuries represent the leading cause of death for Polish men up to 44 years of age. The most common cause of road crashes in Poland was failure to comply with the rules of the road traffic, such as through excessive speeding. We also found drivers poorly assessed road situations, faced a lack of adequate road infrastructure, and maintained many vehicles in poor condition. Discussion: Despite the variety of measures undertaken to improve safety on Polish roads, including modifications of the law as well as improving road quality, the number of fatalities and injuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes is still considerable, and the losses incurred by Polish society are still substantial. Conclusions: The number of fatalities and injuries as a result of road crashes in Poland remains very high. Multifaceted action to improve safety on the roads in Poland should continue. Keywords: Injury rates; Mortality rates; Road traffic safety; Traffic violations; Vehicle speeding."
"Title: Self-reported general health in older adults in Latin America and the Caribbean: usefulness of the indicator Objectives: To evaluate self-reported general health (SRGH) as a health indicator and to analyze its covariates in people 60 years old or older living in private homes in seven cities of Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was based on data from the Health, Well-Being, and Aging survey (Salud, Bienestar y Envejecimiento, or ""SABE survey""), which was carried out in 1999 and 2000 in Bridgetown, Barbados; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Havana, Cuba; Mexico City, Mexico; Montevideo, Uruguay; Santiago, Chile; and São Paulo, Brazil. The survey looked at the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the participants, several health indicators (self-reported chronic diseases, depression, and cognitive features), the social and family support network, the use of health services, reported and observed functionality, the respondent's income, and the durable consumer goods in the household. In probit regression models, self-reported fair or poor health was used as the dependent variable. The marginal effect of each categorical explanatory variable was used to indicate the difference between the probability of reporting poor health by persons who did or did not have a given characteristic. Results: In all the cities studied the self-reporting of ""excellent"" health was very low (6% or less). The results of the multivariate analysis of the relationships between SRGH and covariates showed: (1) the relative importance of several health indicators as covariates of SRGH, (2) the association between sociodemographic characteristics and SRGH, and (3) the differences or similarities found among the seven cities with respect to the relationships studied. The level of self-rated good health was highest in Buenos Aires and Montevideo (60%), followed by Bridgetown and São Paulo (around 50%) and Havana, Santiago, and Mexico City (between 30% and 40%). The respondents' evaluation of their memory was the factor that was most strongly related to SRGH, followed by satisfaction with nutritional status and satisfaction with life. Conclusions: The SRGH captured multiple facets of the health of the older adults, such as suffering from chronic diseases, the degree of satisfaction with the level of nutrition and with life, perception of memory, and any functional problems. More detailed studies should be undertaken to try to determine the role that the emotional health of older adults in Latin America and the Caribbean plays in the demand for health care, and to determine if there is some association between SRGH and the use of health services."
"Title: What does a good night's sleep mean? Nonlinear relations between sleep and children's cognitive functioning and mental health Abstract Study objectives: We attempted to identify the duration and quality of sleep associated with the optimal child outcomes in key developmental domains including cognitive functioning, academic performance, and mental health. In doing so, we examined nonlinear associations between the sleep and developmental variables. Based on racial/ethnic disparities in children's sleep, we assessed this variable as a moderator of examined relations. Methods: Two hundred eighty-two children participated (Mage = 9.4 years, SD = .72; 52% boys; 65% white/European American, 35% black/African American). Sleep was examined with actigraphy for seven consecutive nights and with self-reports. Actigraphy-based sleep duration (minutes) and quality (efficiency), as well as self-reported sleep quality were derived. Children reported on their mental health and were administered cognitive performance tests. Mothers and teachers reported on children's mental health; teachers also reported on academic functioning. Schools provided academic achievement data. Results: Sleep duration had an accelerating nonlinear negative association with externalizing behaviors. Nonlinear associations were also detected between both actigraphy-derived and subjective reports of sleep quality and multiple developmental domains including academic functioning and mental health and the best functioning corresponded with the highest levels of sleep quality. Emphasizing the importance of individual differences, several examined associations were moderated by race/ethnicity. Conclusions: Sleep duration and quality emerged as nonlinear predictors of multiple domains of child development. Findings illustrate that the benefits of longer and better-quality sleep did not taper off and that assessments of nonlinear relations may enhance understanding of the nature of associations between sleep and child functioning.

"GBD-2010 overestimates deaths from road injuries in OECD countries: new methods perform poorly. Background: We assessed the quality of Global Burden of Disease-2010 (GBD-2010) estimates of road injury deaths by comparing with government statistics for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries that report to the International Road Traffic Accident Database (IRTAD). Methods: We obtained tabulated data for 25 OECD countries that report to IRTAD and also report vital registration (VR) data to WHO. We collated VR deaths corresponding to the GBD-2010 road injury definition and estimated 'traffic', 'non-traffic' and 'unspecified whether traffic or non-traffic' components. We estimated national road injury deaths by redistributing partially specified causes of death, as was done by GBD until this was replaced by more complex methods in GBD-2010. Results: GBD-2010 estimates of road injury deaths exceeded IRTAD by 45% overall. IRTAD values fell below the GBD-2010 95% uncertainty interval in all but three countries. Mismatch of conceptual scope accounted for about 8% of this discrepancy, 5% was because GBD-2010 included cases other than road traffic and 3% because GBD-2010 (unlike IRTAD) includes deaths >30 days after injury. Pro rata distribution of partially specified causes in VR data gave estimates that were 18% higher than IRTAD but closer than GBD-2010 estimates for all but two countries. Cases in VR data specified as road injury gave estimates closer to IRTAD. Conclusions: GBD-2010 road injury mortality estimates are substantially higher than the road death toll in OECD countries. The discrepancy is not explained by wider scope of the GBD road injury construct nor by undercounting by IRTAD. GBD-2010 likely attributed substantially more deaths with partially specified causes to road injuries than is appropriate. Keywords: Global Burden of Disease; OECD countries; Road traffic injuries."
"Abstract Objective: Michigan's infant mortality rate is consistently higher than the national rate, with persistent and significant racial/ethnic disparities. In Michigan, nine counties account for more than 80% of all infant deaths. A home visiting program serving low-income, first-time mothers in high-risk communities is one strategy to reduce infant mortality. The objective of this study was to quantify the risk of infant mortality based on race/ethnicity within Michigan's highest-risk counties to guide outreach for home visiting services in these counties. Methods: To maximize the efficiency of limited resources and to identify women at highest risk, we used decomposition to develop risk-based, county-specific estimates of excess infant deaths in nine Michigan counties using data from the 2007 to 2009 Michigan resident infant death file linked to the live birth/file. Results: The sample size for these counties was 200,610 live births and 1,836 infant deaths and for the reference population it was 195,180 live births and 1,133 infant deaths The study found that excess mortality varies among populations at the county level when compared to the reference population of infants born to Michigan mothers who attained more than a high school education and were at least 20 years of age at the infant's birth. The excess risk of mortality was highest for African American infants in seven of the nine counties (56.5% to 132.8%) and for Hispanic infants (86.6%) and white infants (48.2%) in one county each. Conclusion: Even with a longstanding commitment and legal mandate to reduce disparities and with efforts to improve outreach into high-risk areas, disparities persist. An improved understanding of the racial/ethnic disparities within communities was useful to focus outreach efforts on reaching women at highest risk as part of subsequent program enrollment."
"Title: Indigenous men's groups and social and emotional well-being: an indigenous doctor's perspective Abstract Objectives: Traditional indigenous society promoted the social and emotional well-being of indigenous men through the meeting of men in daily life and during ceremonial times. There is an increasing recognition that men's groups use similar mechanisms to enhance the social and emotional well-being of participants and their communities. This paper seeks to increase understanding of the processes and impacts of contemporary indigenous men's groups from an indigenous doctor's perspective. Method: Review of published and unpublished literature and reflections on the primary author's experiences within several indigenous men's groups using a participatory action research model were used to examine how participation within these groups can improve social and emotional well-being. Results: There is a scarcity of published data on the distribution, activities and outcomes of indigenous men's groups. Published qualitative and experiential observations suggest that they contribute to improved social and emotional well-being for participants, their families and communities. Conclusions: Men's groups may be a good adjunct to the outpatient care of indigenous patients. As the published literature is entirely qualitative, mixed methods evaluation using appropriate and sensitive measures would assist in systematically capturing the impacts and outcomes of men's groups. Such evaluations could enhance programme longevity and encourage the referral of patients by mainstream mental health practitioners.

"Road traffic collisions in Malawi: Trends and patterns of mortality on scene. Background Worldwide, 90% of injury deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Road traffic collisions (RTCs) are increasingly common and result in more death and disability in the developing world than in the developed world. We aimed to examine the pre-hospital case fatality rate from RTCs in Malawi. Material and methods A retrospective study was performed utilizing the Malawian National Road Safety Council (NRSC) registry from 2008-2012. The NRSC data were collected at the scene by police officers. Victim, vehicle, and environmental factors were used to describe the characteristics of fatal collisions. Case fatality rate was defined as the number of fatalities divided by the number of people involved in RTCs each year. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of crash scene fatality. Results A total of 11,467 RTCs were reported by the NRSC between 2008 and 2012. Of these, 34% involved at least one fatality at the scene. The average age of fatalities was 32 years and 82% were male. Drivers of motor vehicles had the lowest odds of mortality following RTCs. Compared to drivers; pedestrians had the highest odds of mortality (OR 39, 95% CI 34, 45) followed by bicyclists (OR 26, 95% CI 22, 31). The average case fatality rate was 17% year, and showed an increased throughout the study period. Conclusions RTCs are a common cause of injury in Malawi. Approximately one-third of RTCs involved at least one death at the scene. Pedestrians were particularly vulnerable, exhibiting very high odds of mortality when involved in a road traffic collision. We encourage the use of these data to develop strategies in LMIC countries to protect pedestrians and other road users from RTCs."
"Title: Evaluation of a school-based health promotion programme for adolescents aged 12-15 years with focus on well-being related to stress. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate a school-based adolescent health promotion programme with focus on well-being related to stress. STUDY DESIGN Interventional and evaluative with tests before and after the intervention. The study was performed in two secondary schools in a town on the west coast of Sweden. METHODS A health promotion programme comprising massage and mental training was implemented for a single academic year in one school (intervention school, 153 participants) in order to strengthen and maintain well-being. No intervention was implemented in the other school (non-intervention school, 287 participants). A questionnaire was developed and tested, resulting in 23 items distributed across the following six areas: self-reliance; leisure time; being an outsider; general and home satisfaction; school satisfaction; and school environment. RESULTS A pre- and postintervention comparison of the six areas was made within each school. In the intervention school, the boys maintained a very good or good sense of well-being related to stress in all six areas, while the girls' sense of well-being was maintained in five areas and deteriorated in one area. In the non-intervention school, the boys maintained a very good or good sense of well-being related to stress in four areas and deteriorated in two areas, while the girls' sense of well-being was maintained in two areas and deteriorated in four areas. CONCLUSION Massage and mental training helped to maintain adolescents' very good or good sense of well-being related to stress. A questionnaire with acceptable validity and reliability was developed and tested in order to evaluate the health promotional approach. However, there is a need for further study to develop both the intervention and the questionnaire for young people."
"Title: Surrogate mothers 10 years on: a longitudinal study of psychological well-being and relationships with the parents and child. STUDY QUESTION How do the psychological health and experiences of surrogate mothers change from 1 year to 10 years following the birth of the surrogacy child? SUMMARY ANSWER The psychological well-being of surrogate mothers did not change 10 years following the birth, with all remaining positive about the surrogacy arrangement and the majority continuing to report good mental health. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Studies have found that surrogates may find the weeks following the birth difficult, but do not experience psychological problems 6 months or 1 year later. Research has also shown that surrogates can form close relationships with the intended parents during the pregnancy which may continue after the birth. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This study used a prospective longitudinal design, in which 20 surrogates were seen at two time points: 1 year following the birth of the surrogacy child and 10 years later. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The 20 surrogates (representing 59% of the original sample) participated in a semi-structured interview and completed self-report questionnaires. Eleven surrogates were gestational carriers and nine surrogates had used their own oocyte (genetic surrogacy). Four were previously known to the intended parents and 16 were previously not known. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Ten years following the birth of the surrogacy child, surrogate mothers scored within the normal range for self-esteem and did not show signs of depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory. Marital quality remained positive over time. All surrogates reported that their expectations of their relationship with the intended parents had been either met or exceeded and most reported positive feelings towards the child. In terms of expectations for the future, most surrogates reported that they would like to maintain contact or would be available to the child if the child wished to contact them. None expressed regrets about their involvement in surrogacy. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The sample size of this study was small and the women may not be representative of all surrogates. Therefore the extent to which these findings can be generalized is not known. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Contrary to concerns about the potentially negative long-term effect of surrogacy, the findings suggest that surrogacy can be a positive experience for some women at least. These findings are important for policy and practice of surrogacy around the world."
"Title: A Longitudinal Study on Motherhood and Well-Being: Developmental and Clinical Implications Un estudio longitudinal sobre maternidad y bienestar: Implicaciones evolutivas y clínicas Pregnancy and puerperium are crucial periods at both the biological and psychological levels. The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate women’s perceived health and illness during pregnancy and puerperium through the assessment of hedonic and eudaimonic components of well-being, symptoms of peripartum depression, and their relationship. Nineteen women recruited at the Unit of Obstetrics and Gynecology of a university hospital in Northern Italy were enrolled and answered a set of questionnaires at two time points: 20-22 weeks of gestation and 6 months after childbirth. Results showed a substantial lack of correlation between the dimensions of mental illness and mental health. The analysis of the well- and ill-being components showed low levels of depression as well as good levels of mental health, especially concerning the eudaimonic components of well-being, both during and after pregnancy. Overall, findings attested to a general stability of well-being over pregnancy and puerperium."
"Title: Validation of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy—Spiritual Well-being (FACIT-Sp12) on French Old People The study aimed to develop a French version of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy—Spiritual Well-being short version (FACIT-Sp12), in order to provide a self-reported measure for French people in the field of gerontology. The study involving 63 nursing home residents was conducted to evaluate the construct validity, reliability, and convergence validity of the FACIT-Sp12. A confirmatory factor analysis corroborated a three-factor model (Meaning, Peace and Faith) with modifications for two items, also valid among people with cognitive impairment. Subscales showed good internal consistency and are correlated with quality of life and depression. In conclusion, the validated French version is an suitable instrument to study the maintenance and promotion of quality of life in the elderly."
"Socioeconomic and environmental determinants of under-five mortality in Gamo Gofa Zone, Southern Ethiopia: a matched case control study Background: Despite global declaration of the right to life as a fundamental human right and substantial progress in reducing childhood mortality, unacceptably high number of children still die before their fifth birthday every day. Different factors have been studied and implicated for under-five mortality with mixed results. Mortality studies in the current study sites were lacking. Therefore, this study examined environmental and socioeconomic determinants of under-five mortality. Methods: The study applied a matched case control study design on 381 cases of children who died before their fifth birthday and 762 controls born within 1 month in the same locality as the cases. We conducted weighted conditional logistic regression to assess the association between selected factors and mortality status. Result: The odds of death was found to be significantly lower among children of mothers whose educational status was grade nine or above (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 0.34(0.16-0.72)). The odds of death was significantly higher among children whose mothers' marital status were separated/divorced or widowed (AOR of 3.60(1.23-10.47)) and whose fathers were daily laborers (AOR of 2.34(1.29-4.23)). Presence of separate kitchen in the household for cooking was a proximate factor which was significantly associated with under-five mortality with AOR of 1.77(1.16-2.70). Conclusion: Socioeconomic factors like maternal education, husband occupation and marital status of the mother were shown to be significantly associated with under-five mortality. Hence, in order to enhance reduction in childhood mortality, investing on maternal education targeting those at risk groups is recommended.

"Suicide Rates After Discharge From Psychiatric Facilities: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Importance: High rates of suicide after psychiatric hospitalization are reported in many studies, yet the magnitude of the increases and the factors underlying them remain unclear. Objectives: To quantify the rates of suicide after discharge from psychiatric facilities and examine what moderates those rates. Data sources: English-language, peer-reviewed publications published from January 1, 1946, to May 1, 2016, were located using MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and EMBASE with the search terms ((suicid*).ti AND (hospital or discharg* OR inpatient or in-patient OR admit*).ab and ((mortality OR outcome* OR death*) AND (psych* OR mental*)).ti AND (admit* OR admis* or hospital* OR inpatient* OR in-patient* OR discharg*).ab. Hand searching was also done. Study selection: Studies reporting the number of suicides among patients discharged from psychiatric facilities and the number of exposed person-years and studies from which these data could be calculated. Data extraction and synthesis: The meta-analysis adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. A random-effects model was used to calculate a pooled estimate of postdischarge suicides per 100 000 person-years. Main outcomes and measures: The suicide rate after discharge from psychiatric facilities was the main outcome, and the association between the duration of follow-up and the year of the sampling were the main a priori moderators. Results: A total of 100 studies reported 183 patient samples (50 samples of females, 49 of males, and 84 of mixed sex; 129 of adults or unspecified patients, 20 of adolescents, 19 of older patients, and 15 from long-term or forensic discharge facilities), including a total of 17 857 suicides during 4 725 445 person-years. The pooled estimate postdischarge suicide rate was 484 suicides per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 422-555 suicides per 100 000 person-years; prediction interval, 89-2641), with high between-sample heterogeneity (I2 = 98%). The suicide rate was highest within 3 months after discharge (1132; 95% CI, 874-1467) and among patients admitted with suicidal ideas or behaviors (2078; 95% CI, 1512-2856). Pooled suicide rates per 100 000 patients-years were 654 for studies with follow-up periods of 3 months to 1 year, 494 for studies with follow-up periods of 1 to 5 years, 366 for studies with follow-up periods of 5 to 10 years, and 277 for studies with follow-up periods longer than 10 years. Suicide rates were higher among samples collected in the periods 1995-2004 (656; 95% CI, 518-831) and 2005-2016 (672; 95% CI, 428-1055) than in earlier samples. Conclusions and relevance: The immediate postdischarge period is a time of marked risk, but rates of suicide remain high for many years after discharge. Patients admitted because of suicidal ideas or behaviors and those in the first months after discharge should be a particular focus of concern. Previously admitted patients should be able to access long-term care and assistance."
"Association of Suicide and Other Mortality With Emergency Department Presentation Importance: Emergency departments (EDs) have the potential to play a pivotal role in suicide risk detection and prevention, yet little is known about the profile of risk of suicide after ED visits in the United States. Objectives: To examine 1-year incidence of suicide and other mortality among ED patients who presented with nonfatal deliberate self-harm, suicidal ideation, or any other chief concern, and to examine sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with suicide mortality risk. Design, setting, and participants: This retrospective cohort study included statewide, all-payer, longitudinally linked ED patient records and mortality data from all California residents who presented to a California-licensed ED at least 1 time from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011, with deliberate self-harm, suicidal ideation but not self-harm, or neither (a 5% random sample). Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicide and other manners or causes of death were determined for each patient group using statewide mortality data. Data were analyzed from January 10 to July 18, 2019. Main outcomes and measures: Suicide and other manners or causes of death were ascertained using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes. Suicide rate and all mortality rates were measured per 100 000 person-years. Results: Among 648 646 individuals (mean [SD] age, 43.8 [20.6] years; 350 687 [54.1%] women) who visited an ED in California from 2009 to 2011, the rates of suicide deaths per 100 000 person-years in the year after index ED presentation were 693.4 deaths among 83 507 individuals presenting with deliberate self-harm (SMR, 56.8; 95% CI, 52.1-61.4), 384.5 deaths among 67 379 individuals presenting with suicidal ideation but not self-harm (SMR, 31.4; 95% CI, 27.5-35.2), and 23.4 deaths among 497 760 reference patients (SMR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6-2.3). Compared with the demographically matched general population, the rates of nonsuicide external-cause mortality were also increased among patients with self-harm (SMR, 14.2; 95% CI, 12.9-15.5), patients with suicidal ideation (SMR, 11.8; 95% CI, 10.6-13.0), and reference patients (SMR, 2.2; 95% CI, 2.0-2.3). In all 3 groups, the rates of suicide mortality per 100 000 person-years were higher among men (deliberate self-harm: 1011.1 deaths; suicidal ideation: 539.8 deaths; reference: 36.6 deaths), people 65 years or older (deliberate self-harm: 1919.5 deaths; suicidal ideation: 691.2 deaths; reference: 28.6 deaths), and non-Hispanic white patients (deliberate self-harm: 914.1 deaths; suicidal ideation: 511.6 deaths; reference: 33.8 deaths) than among their respective referent groups. Other sociodemographic factors and clinical diagnoses were associated with striking differences in suicide rates, but these patterns were heterogeneous across patient groups. Conclusions and relevance: These findings suggest that ED patients with deliberate self-harm or suicidal ideation are associated with substantially increased risk of suicide and other mortality during the year after ED presentation. The process of planning for ED discharge may present opportunities to help ensure safe transitions to continuing outpatient mental health care and to consider broader risk for unintentional injury and other causes of premature mortality."
"Suicide mortality among Pacific peoples in New Zealand, 1996-2013. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe trends in suicide mortality for Pacific peoples in New Zealand by reviewing official data over the period 1996-2013. METHOD: Death registrations where the underlying causes of death were intentional self-harm was examined and area of interest was identified and presented. RESULTS: Over a 17-year period (1996-2013), there were 380 total Pacific suicides (4.1%) out of 9,307 suicides nationally for New Zealand's total population. CONCLUSION: Priority areas for effective suicide prevention include: Pacific young males, Pacific ethnic foci, clear ethnic disparities and inequalities for Pacific suicide mortality when compared to New Zealand's total population; safe, ethical and culturally appropriate messaging around suicide methods; the importance of the role of mental health and addictions in suicide prevention. On average, there are at least 22 Pacific suicides annually in New Zealand. Irrespective of small numbers, further Pacific ethnic breakdown is needed other than Samoan, Cook Islands and Tongan, as this is problematic for suicide prevention efforts for the exclusion of other Pacific groups."
"Pregnancy-related mortality in the United States, 2006-2010 Objective:                    To update national population-level pregnancy-related mortality estimates and examine characteristics and causes of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States during 2006-2010. Methods:                    We used data from the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System and calculated pregnancy-related mortality ratios by year and age group for four race-ethnicity groups: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other. We examined causes of pregnancy-related deaths by pregnancy outcome during 2006-2010 and compared causes of pregnancy-related deaths since 1987. Results:                    The 2006-2010 pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 16.0 deaths per 100,000 live births (20,959,533 total live births). Specific race-ethnicity pregnancy-related mortality ratios were 12.0, 38.9, 11.7, and 14.2 deaths per 100,000 live births for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other race women, respectively. Pregnancy-related mortality ratios increased with maternal age for all women and within all age groups, non-Hispanic black women had the highest risk of dying from pregnancy complications. Over time, the contribution to pregnancy-related deaths of hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, embolism, and anesthesia complications continued to decline, whereas the contribution of cardiovascular conditions and infection increased. Seven of 10 categories of causes of death each contributed from 9.4% to 14.6% of all 2006-2010 pregnancy-related deaths; cardiovascular conditions ranked first. Conclusion:                    Relative to previous years, during 2006-2010, the U.S. pregnancy-related mortality ratio increased as did the contribution of cardiovascular conditions and infection to pregnancy-related mortality. Although the identification of pregnancy-related deaths may be improving in the United States, the increasing contribution of chronic diseases to pregnancy-related mortality suggests a change in risk profile of the birthing population. Level of evidence:                    II."
"Characteristics of deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland from 2005 to 2011 and use of health services prior to death Background:                    Service presentation may offer an opportunity for intervention prior to suicide. The study aimed to examine the characteristics, disorders and service use profiles of those who had died by suicide in Northern Ireland (NI) from 2005 to 2011. Methods:                    An analysis of a database of deaths by suicide and undetermined intent based on data in the NI Coronial files from 2005 to 2011 (N=1667). Results:                    Males are three times as likely to die by suicide as females and suicide rates similar among those aged 20-60 years. Females have increased service use prior to suicide; males tend to disengage with services prior to death. Females are more likely to have recorded prior attempts, service use, diagnosis and referral. The most common health service used was primary care. Limitations:                    Despite the inclusion of undetermined deaths (probable suicides) a proportion of deaths by suicide remain unrecorded as such. Data on marital status and mental and physical disorders were based on information recorded by police officers from relatives, other informants and medical records. The reliability of this data may therefore be questioned. Conclusions:                    Primary care has an important role in suicide prevention. Gendered patterns in service use prior to death should be considered in suicide prevention programmes. It is important to strengthen clinicians׳ knowledge of the manifestations of suicidal ideation in males and ways of encouraging service use in males. The NI population who were exposed to the height of the violence of the conflict appear to be at increased risk of suicide as they age."
"Traumatic brain injury in the Netherlands, trends in emergency department visits, hospitalization and mortality between 1998 and 2012 Background:                    Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The effects of epidemiological changes such as ageing of the population and increased traffic safety on the incidence of TBI are unknown. Objective:                    The objective of this study was to evaluate trends in TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization and mortality in the Netherlands between 1998 and 2012. Design:                    This was a retrospective observational, longitudinal study. Main outcome measures:                    The main outcome measures were TBI-related ED visits, hospitalization and mortality. Results:                    Between 1998 and 2012, there were 500 000 TBI-related ED visits in the Netherlands. In the same period, there were 222 000 TBI-related admissions and 17 000 TBI-related deaths. During this period, there was a 75% increase in ED visits for TBI and a 95% increase for TBI-related hospitalization; overall mortality because of TBI did not change significantly. Despite the overall increase in TBI-related ED visits, this increase was not evenly distributed among age groups or trauma mechanisms. In patients younger than 65 years, a declining trend in ED visits for TBI caused by road traffic accidents was observed. Among patients 65 years or older, ED visits for TBI caused by a fall increased markedly. TBI-related mortality shifted from mainly young (67%) and middle-aged individuals (<65 years) to mainly elderly (63%) individuals (≥65 years) between 1998 and 2012. The conclusions of this study did not change when adjusting for changes in age, sex and overall population growth. Conclusion:                    The incidence of TBI-related ED visits and hospitalization increased markedly between 1998 and 2012 in the Netherlands. TBI-related mortality occurred at an older age. These observations are probably the result of a change in aetiology of TBI, specifically a decrease in traffic accidents and an increase in falls in the ageing population. This hypothesis is supported by our data. However, ageing of the population is not the only cause of the changes observed; the observed changes remained significant when correcting for age and sex. The higher incidence of TBI with a relatively stable mortality rate highlights the importance of clinical decision rules to identify patients with a high risk of poor outcome after TBI."
"Neonatal and under-five mortality rate in Indian districts with reference to Sustainable Development Goal 3: An analysis of the National Family Health Survey of India (NFHS), 2015-2016 Background and objective: India contributes the highest global share of deaths among the under-fives. Continuous monitoring of the reduction in the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) at local level is thus essential to set priorities for policy-makers and health professionals. In this study, we aimed to provide an update on district-level disparities in the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and the U5MR with special reference to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) on preventable deaths among new-borns and children under five. Data and methods: We used recently released population-based cross-sectional data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2015-2016. We used the synthetic cohort probability approach to analyze the full birth history information of women aged 15-49 to estimate the NMR and U5MR for the ten years preceding the survey. Results: Both the NMR and U5MR vary enormously across Indian districts. With respect to the SDG3 target for 2030 for the NMR and the U5MR, the estimated NMR for India for the period studied is about 2.4 times higher, while the estimated U5MR is about double. At district level, while 9% of the districts have already reached the NMR targeted in SDG3, nearly half (315 districts) are not likely to achieve the 2030 target even if they realize the NMR reductions achieved by their own states between the last two rounds of National Family Health Survey of India. Similarly, less than one-third of the districts (177) of India are unlikely to achieve the SDG3 target on the U5MR by 2030. While the majority of high-risk districts for the NMR and U5MR are located in the poorer states of north-central and eastern India, a few high-risk districts for NMR also fall in the rich and advanced states. About 97% of districts from Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh, for example, are unlikely to meet the SDG3 target for preventable deaths among new-borns and children under age five, irrespective of gender. Conclusions: To achieve the SDG3 target on preventable deaths by 2030, the majority of Indian districts clearly need to make a giant leap to reduce their NMR and U5MR."
"Suicide in Serbia. BACKGROUND: Suicide remains a significant public health problem worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the mortality trend of suicide in Serbia for the years 1991-2014. METHODS: Data on persons who died of suicide and self-inflicted injury  (site codes E950-E959 revision 9 and X60-X84 revision 10 of the International Classification of Diseases to classify death, injury and cause of death) were obtained from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia. The age standardized rate was calculated by direct method (per 100,000 persons, using Segi's World population as standard population). Average annual percentage change (AAPC) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed for trend using the joinpoint regression analysis. RESULTS: Total 33,930 (24,016 men and 9914 women) suicide deaths occurred in Serbia during the observed period, with the average annual age-standardized mortality rate being 12.7 per 100,000 inhabitants (19.5 per 100,000 in men and 6.7 per 100,000 in women). Suicide mortality in all age groups was higher among men than women. In both genders, suicide rates were highest in the oldest age group. Significantly decreased trend in suicide mortality was recorded continuously from 1991 to 2014 (AAPC=-1.9%, 95%CI -2.2 to -1.6). The most frequently used suicide method in both genders was hanging, strangulation or suffocation with 61.2% off all suicides. Changes in mortality rates were significant both for suicide by firearms, air guns and explosives (AAPC=-1.5% (AAPC=-1.5% in men and -3.1%-3.1% in women) and for suicide by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation (AAPC=-1.2%  (AAPC=-1.2% in men and -3.0%-3.0% in women). In men, nonsignificant increase in suicide by firearms, air guns and explosives observed during the period 1991-1997  (by +6.1% per year) was followed by a significant decrease until 2014 (by -3.1% per year). The significantly increased mortality in suicide by firearms, air guns, and explosives was observed in older men (aged 40-69 years and 80 years and over). LIMITATIONS: The low rate of autopsies in Serbia, as well as the accuracy, reliability and comparability of the suicide mortality data is always a question. CONCLUSIONS: Downward trend in suicide mortality occurred in Serbia in last two decades. However, suicide rates are still very high in Serbia compared with the rates of suicides in developed countries. Particularly worrisome is the increase in mortality in older men, especially due to firearm suicides, air rifles, and explosives. Thus, additional efforts in the prevention of suicide are very important."
"Estimation of changes in maternal mortality in a rural district of northern Tanzania during the last 50 years Objective:                    Maternal mortality remains a major challenge worldwide. Reliable information concerning ratios and trends is essential for resource mobilization and assessment of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Design:                    Assessment of levels and trends in maternal mortality during the last 50 years. Setting:                    Sengerema district, rural North Tanzania. Population:                    Number of deliveries, births, admissions, maternal deaths and causes of maternal mortality in the only hospital in the area. Methods:                    We compiled a database from the annual hospital reports for the period of 1962-2011 to obtain estimated maternal mortality ratio for each decade. Main outcome measures:                    Maternal mortality ratio for each decade and classification of maternal deaths. Results:                    Of 629 maternal deaths, 490 (77.9%) could be classified as either direct or indirect and causes of mortality ascertained. Of the 361 direct causes (73.7%), hemorrhage (29.8%) and sepsis (20.4%) were the leading causes. Of the 129 indirect causes (26.3%), anemia during pregnancy (6.5%), meningitis (4.1%), HIV-AIDS (3.5%), malaria (2.9%), heart diseases (2.4%) and relapsing fever (2.0%) were most often diagnosed. Since 1962, a 63% decrease in maternal mortality ratio has been achieved. The hospital-based maternal mortality ratio decreased from 770/100,000 to 282/100,000 in the last decade (95% confidence interval 244/100,000, 320/100,000). The yearly decline since 1962 was 1.3%. Conclusions:                    During the last 50 years we have witnessed a reduction of maternal mortality and improvements in maternal health. Progress has been made towards improving Millennium Development Goal 5, although only a prospective population-based survey will provide the ultimate answer."
"﻿Female genital mutilation--experience of The Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne. This study was performed to improve our knowledge and understanding of the needs of women affected by female genital mutilation. We looked at the types of complications of these practices which present to a large metropolitan women's hospital in order to determine how we can appropriately treat and support affected women. This was an observational study of women from countries with a high prevalence of female genital mutilation who presented to the Royal Women's Hospital between October, 1995 and January, 1997. Fifty-one patients with a past history of female genital mutilation who were attending the hospital for antenatal or gynaecological care consented to participate in the study. We found that 77.6% of women identified as having had female genital mutilation had undergone infibulation. More than 85% of the women in our study reported a complication of the procedure. The major complications were dyspareunia, apareunia and urinary tract infections; 29.4% of these women required surgery to facilitate intercourse. In our study group there was no difference in Caesarean section rates between the women who had previously delivered in Australia compared with those who had delivered in Africa. Women who have had a female genital mutilation procedure have specific needs for their care which present challenges to both their general practitioners and obstetrician/gynaecologists. These women have significant complications related to their procedure including social and psychosexual problems which require sympathetic management. LESS"
"Title: Evolution of phenotypic plasticity in extreme environments Abstratc:Phenotypic plasticity, if adaptive, may allow species to counter the detrimental effects of extreme conditions, but the infrequent occurrence of extreme environments and/or their restriction to low-quality habitats within a species range means that they exert little direct selection on reaction norms. Plasticity could, therefore, be maladaptive under extreme environments, unless genetic correlations are strong between extreme and non-extreme environmental states, and the optimum phenotype changes smoothly with the environment. Empirical evidence suggests that populations and species from more variable environments show higher levels of plasticity that might preadapt them to extremes, but genetic variance for plastic responses can also be low, and genetic variation may not be expressed for some classes of traits under extreme conditions. Much of the empirical literature on plastic responses to extremes has not yet been linked to ecologically relevant conditions, such as asymmetrical fluctuations in the case of temperature extremes. Nevertheless, evolved plastic responses are likely to be important for natural and agricultural species increasingly exposed to climate extremes, and there is an urgent need to collect empirical information and link this to model predictions. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Behavioural, ecological and evolutionary responses to extreme climatic events'."
"Title: Climate change impacts and adaptation in cities: a review of the literature Abstract: Many of the decisions relating to future urban development require information on climate change risks to cities This review of the academic and “grey” literature provides an overview assessment of the state of the art in the quantification and valuation of climate risks at the city-scale. We find that whilst a small number of cities, mostly in OECD countries, have derived quantitative estimates of the costs of climate change risks under alternative scenarios, this form of analysis is in its infancy. The climate risks most frequently addressed in existing studies are associated with sea-level rise, health and water resources. Other sectors such as energy, transport, and built infrastructure remain less studied. The review has also undertaken a case study to examine the progress in two cities—London and New York—which are relatively advanced in the assessment of climate risks and adaptation. The case studies show that these cities have benefited from stakeholder engagement at an early stage in their risk assessments. They have also benefited from the development of specific institutional responsibilities for co-ordinating such research from the outset. This involvement has been critical in creating momentum and obtaining resources for subsequent in-depth analysis of sectoral impacts and adaptation needs. While low cost climate down-scaling applications would be useful in future research, the greatest priority is to develop responses that can work within the high future uncertainty of future climate change, to build resilience and maintain flexibility. This can best be used within the context of established risk management practices."
"Title: Perspectives on the causes of exceptionally low 2015 snowpack in the western United States Abstract: Augmenting previous papers about the exceptional 2011–2015 California drought, we offer new perspectives on the “snow drought” that extended into Oregon in 2014 and Washington in 2015. Over 80% of measurement sites west of 115°W experienced record low snowpack in 2015, and we estimate a return period of 400–1000 years for California's snowpack under the questionable assumption of stationarity. Hydrologic modeling supports the conclusion that 2015 was the most severe on record by a wide margin. Using a crowd-sourced superensemble of regional climate model simulations, we show that both human influence and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies contributed strongly to the risk of snow drought in Oregon and Washington: the contribution of SST anomalies was about twice that of human influence. By contrast, SSTs and humans appear to have played a smaller role in creating California's snow drought. In all three states, the anthropogenic effect on temperature exacerbated the snow drought"
"Title: Is robustness really robust? How different definitions of robustness impact decision-making under climate change Abstract: Robust decision-making is being increasingly used to support environmental resources decisions and policy analysis under changing climate and society. In this context, a robust decision is a decision that is as much as possible insensitive to a large degree of uncertainty and ensures certain performance across multiple plausible futures. Yet, the concept of robustness is neither unique nor static. Multiple robustness metrics, such as maximin, optimism-pessimism, max regret, have been proposed in the literature, reflecting diverse optimistic/pessimistic attitudes by the decision maker. Further, these attitudes can evolve in time as a response to sequences of favorable (or adverse) events, inducing possible dynamic changes in the robustness metrics. In this paper, we explore the impact of alternative definitions of robustness and their evolution in time for a case of water resources system management under changing climate. We study the decisions of the Lake Como operator, who is called to regulate the lake by balancing irrigation supply and flood control, under an ensemble of climate change scenarios. Results show a considerable variability in the system performance across multiple robustness metrics. In fact, the mis-definition of the actual decision maker’s attitude biases the simulation of its future decisions and produces a general underestimation of the system performance. The analysis of the dynamic evolution of the decision maker’s preferences further confirms the potentially strong impact of changing robustness definition on the decision-making outcomes. Climate change impact assessment studies should therefore include the definition of robustness among the uncertain parameters of the problem in order to analyze future human decisions under uncertainty."
"Title: Solvent extraction, separation and recovery of dysprosium (Dy) and neodymium (Nd) from aqueous solutions: Waste recycling strategies for permanent magnet processing Abstract: Nowadays, permanent magnets (PMs) play a key role in electrical and electronic goods, and thus, their demand is incessantly increasing in countries such as Korea. These PMs significantly utilize dysprosium (Dy) and neodymium (Nd) during their manufacturing. But it is observed that when these magnets reach their end of life, they are treated as scrap containing a lot of valuable metals. Moreover, at the time of their production in industries, certain scraps are generated from which metals could be recovered. The availability of an appreciable amount of rare earth in such scraps caught the attention of the researchers and recycling is found to be the best method to recuperate metals from these scrap PMs. This will reduce the practice of land filling as well as environmental impact. The present paper highlights the resource recycling strategies for PMs for recovering Dy and Nd using a solvent extraction method. The role of organophosphorus extractants during extraction, separation and recovery of Dy and Nd is discussed briefly and reviewed. Flow-sheets discussing the use of organophosphorus extractants to recover Dy and Nd products by commercial operation are highlighted in the present review. Moreover, a case study is presented comparing two extractants based on phosphorus (P) i.e. di(2-ethyl-hexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and 2-ethyl-hexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethyl-hexyl ester (PC 88A), implemented for the recovery of Dy and Nd using hydrometallurgical techniques. Various experimental conditions such as the maximum loading rates, theoretical extraction stages, scrubbing processes, and stripping processes are addressed for both extractants. This piece of comparative and summarized review will be useful for the researchers/industrialists working in the area of rare earth extraction."
"Title: Differences in tolerance to anthropogenic stress between invasive and native bivalves Abstract: Tolerance towards environmental stress has been frequently considered as one of the key determinants of invasion success. However, empirical evidence supporting the assumption that invasive species can better endure unfavorable conditions compared with native species is limited and has yielded opposing results. In this study, we examined the tolerance to different stress conditions (thermal stress and trace metal zinc pollution stress) in two phylogenetically related and functionally similar freshwater bivalve species, the native Anodonta anatina and the invasive Sinanodonta woodiana. We assessed potential differences in response to stress conditions using several cellular response assays: efficiency of the multixenobiotic resistance mechanism, respiration estimate (INT reduction capacity), and enzymatic biomarkers. Our results demonstrated that the invasive species overall coped much better with unfavorable conditions. The higher tolerance of S. woodiana was evident from (i) significantly decreased Rhodamine B accumulation indicating more efficient multixenobiotic resistance mechanism; (ii) significantly higher INT reduction capacity and (iii) less pronounced alterations in the activity of stress-related enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, catalase) and of a neurotoxicity biomarker (cholinesterase) in the majority of treatment conditions in both stress trials. Higher tolerance to thermal extremes may provide physiological benefit for further invasion success of S. woodiana in European freshwaters, especially in the context of climate change."
"Title: Testing the greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential of alternative strategies for the english housing stock Abstract: Buildings account for around a third of global energy and process emissions, but have been delivering much smaller emissions savings than other sectors. Although clear standards of new building construction and retrofitting options have been developed and are able to reduce building emissions, there is need for a clear prioritisation of policy options capable of delivering the greatest reduction in emissions at minimal costs. This requires an assessment of the trade-offs between new construction and retrofitting in terms of the pace of adoption of improved building standards and the emissions savings achieved to meet current climate targets. In this paper, a dynamic material flow analysis is used to explore the impact of combined mitigation strategies on both new and existing buildings capable of reducing embodied and operational emissions in the English domestic housing stock. The results show that progress in the use of low carbon materials in construction and the deployment of zero-carbon buildings at scale would not be enough to deliver a reduction of building emissions of the scale required nationally (–66% from current levels by 2050). Improvement in building standards for both new and pre-existing construction is essential to meet targets, but its costs are likely to be unreasonable without a reduction in the demand for floor area per capita by promoting flexible design of buildings, house sharing or telecommuting, which are likely to produce far-reaching implications in social organisation and urban planning."
"Title: Farmers’ Perceptions of Climate Change and Agricultural Adaptation Strategies in Rural Sahel Abstract: Farmers in the Sahel have always been facing climatic variability at intra- and inter-annual and decadal time scales. While coping and adaptation strategies have traditionally included crop diversification, mobility, livelihood diversification, and migration, singling out climate as a direct driver of changes is not so simple. Using focus group interviews and a household survey, this study analyzes the perceptions of climate change and the strategies for coping and adaptation by sedentary farmers in the savanna zone of central Senegal. Households are aware of climate variability and identify wind and occasional excess rainfall as the most destructive climate factors. Households attribute poor livestock health, reduced crop yields and a range of other problems to climate factors, especially wind. However, when questions on land use and livelihood change are not asked directly in a climate context, households and groups assign economic, political, and social rather than climate factors as the main reasons for change. It is concluded that the communities studied have a high awareness of climate issues, but climatic narratives are likely to influence responses when questions mention climate. Change in land use and livelihood strategies is driven by adaptation to a range of factors of which climate appears not to be the most important. Implications for policy-making on agricultural and economic development will be to focus on providing flexible options rather than specific solutions to uncertain climate."
"Title: Managing climate change in cities: Will climate action plans work? Abstract: Since the mid-20th century, most large cities of the United States have been warming at more than twice the rate of the planet as a whole. While many municipal and state governments have developed climate action plans designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases typically are not the strongest driver of warming in cities. Our purpose is to evaluate the likely effectiveness of municipal and state level climate action plans in slowing the pace of warming in the most populous U.S. cities over the near-to-medium term. We employ time-series temperature trend analyses to differentiate global from local-scale climate change mechanisms in large U.S. cities between 1961 and 2010. We then review all climate action plans developed at the municipal or state level in the 50 most populous metropolitan regions to identify the various emissions control and heat management strategies incorporated into these plans. The results of our assessment suggest that the climate change management policies adopted through municipal and state climate action plans may fail to adequately protect human health and welfare from rapidly rising temperatures. Based on our review, we recommend that municipal and state governments broaden climate action plans to include heat management strategies in addition to greenhouse gas emissions controls."
"Title: Complex networks reveal global pattern of extreme-rainfall teleconnections Abstract: Climatic observables are often correlated across long spatial distances, and extreme events, such as heatwaves or floods, are typically assumed to be related to such teleconnections1,2. Revealing atmospheric teleconnection patterns and understanding their underlying mechanisms is of great importance for weather forecasting in general and extreme-event prediction in particular3,4, especially considering that the characteristics of extreme events have been suggested to change under ongoing anthropogenic climate change5–8. Here we reveal the global coupling pattern of extreme-rainfall events by applying complex-network methodology to high-resolution satellite data and introducing a technique that corrects for multiple-comparison bias in functional networks. We find that the distance distribution of significant connections (P < 0.005) around the globe decays according to a power law up to distances of about 2,500 kilometres. For longer distances, the probability of significant connections is much higher than expected from the scaling of the power law. We attribute the shorter, power-law-distributed connections to regional weather systems. The longer, super-power-law-distributed connections form a global rainfall teleconnection pattern that is probably controlled by upper-level Rossby waves. We show that extreme-rainfall events in the monsoon systems of south-central Asia, east Asia and Africa are significantly synchronized. Moreover, we uncover concise links between south-central Asia and the European and North American extratropics, as well as the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Analysis of the atmospheric conditions that lead to these teleconnections confirms Rossby waves as the physical mechanism underlying these global teleconnection patterns and emphasizes their crucial role in dynamical tropical–extratropical couplings. Our results provide insights into the function of Rossby waves in creating stable, global-scale dependencies of extreme-rainfall events, and into the potential predictability of associated natural hazards."
"Title: Do city climate plans reduce emissions? Abstract: More than 600 local governments in the US are developing climate action plans that lay out specific measures to reduce emissions from municipal operations, households and firms. To date, however, it is unclear whether these plans are being implemented or have any causal effects on emissions. Using data from California, I provide the first quantitative analysis of the impacts of climate plans. I find that cities with climate plans have had far greater success in implementing strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than their counterparts without such plans. For example, they have more green buildings, spend more on pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, and have implemented more programs to divert waste from methane-generating landfills. I find little evidence, however, that climate plans play any causal role in this success. Rather, citizens’ environmental preferences appear to be a more important driver of both the adoption of climate plans and the pursuit of specific emission reduction measures. Thus, climate plans are largely codifying outcomes that would have been achieved in any case."
"Title: Interacting effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation on drought-sensitive butterflies Abstract: Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of some climatic extremes. These may have drastic impacts on biodiversity, particularly if meteorological thresholds are crossed, leading to population collapses. Should this occur repeatedly, populations may be unable to recover, resulting in local extinctions. Comprehensive time series data on butterflies in Great Britain provide a rare opportunity to quantify population responses to both past severe drought and the interaction with habitat area and fragmentation. Here, we combine this knowledge with future projections from multiple climate models, for different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and for simultaneous modelled responses to different landscape characteristics. Under RCP8.5, which is associated with business as usual'emissions, widespread drought-sensitive butterfly population extinctions could occur as early as 2050. However, by managing landscapes and particularly reducing habitat fragmentation, the probability of persistence until mid-century improves from around zero to between 6 and 42% (95% confidence interval). Achieving persistence with a greater than 50% chance and right through to 2100 is possible only under both low climate change (RCP2.6) and semi-natural habitat restoration. Our data show that, for these drought-sensitive butterflies, persistence is achieved more effectively by restoring semi-natural landscapes to reduce fragmentation, rather than simply focusing on increasing habitat area, but this will only be successful in combination with substantial emission reductions."
"Title: Regulation and Economic Globalization: Prospects and Limits of Private Governance Abstract: Corporate codes of conduct, product certifications, process standards, and other voluntary, non-governmental forms of private governance have proliferated in the last two decades. These innovations are a response to social pressures unleashed by globalization and the inadequacy of governmental institutions for addressing its social and environmental impacts. Private governance has had some notable successes, but there are clear limits to what it alone can be expected to accomplish. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of private governance depends on four main factors: 1) the structure of the particular global value chain in which production takes place; 2) the extent to which demand for a firm's products relies on its brand identity; 3) the possibilities for collective action by consumers, workers, or other activists to exert pressure on producers; and 4) the extent to which commercial interests of lead firms align with social and environmental concerns. Taken together, these hypotheses suggest that private governance will flourish in only a limited set of circumstances. With the trend towards consolidation of production in the largest developing countries, however, we also see a strengthening of some forms of public governance. Private governance will not disappear, but it will be linked to emerging forms of multi-stakeholder institutions."
"Title: Maximising synergies between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation: Potential enablers for improved planning outcomes Abstract: Recent extreme weather events worldwide have highlighted the vulnerability of many urban settlements to future climatic change. These events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change scenarios. Although the climatic change may be unavoidable, effective planning and response can reduce its impacts. Drawing on empirical data from a 3-year multi-sectoral study of climate change adaptation for human settlements in the South East Queensland region, Australia, this paper draws on multi-sectoral perspectives to propose enablers for maximising synergies between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to achieve improved planning outcomes. Multi-sectoral perspectives are discussed under four groups of identified enablers: spatial planning; cross-sectoral planning; social/community planning; and strategic/long term planning. Based on the findings, a framework is proposed to guide planning systems to maximise synergies between the fields of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to minimise the vulnerability of communities to extreme weather events in highly urbanised areas."
"Effects of global climate change on geographic distributions of vertebrates in North Queensland Abstract: This paper assesses potential changes in the distributions of 12 endemic rainforest vertebrates of the Wet Tropics of Northeastern Australia in response to global warming predictions. It is based on projecting models of current geographic distribution to modelled future conditions taken from regional climate models. In comparing vertebrate species with different mobility, adaptation potential and distribution, consequences of global warming for elements of the regional biodiversity were investigated. The bioclimatic program, BIOCLIM, was used to determine the current climatic ranges and the potential changes in the distributions of the 12 species under four climate change scenarios for the year 2100. Results suggest that even species with currently wide climatic ranges may become vulnerable. Species distribution area decreased by more than 50% on average. Furthermore, the remaining predicted range decreased from an average of 90% under a conservative scenario, to about 40% under a less conservative scenario. These results show how sensitively some species could react to climate change and emphasise the need for rapid action on global warming for biodiversity conservation."
"Title: Extreme climate in China: Facts, simulation and projection Abstarct: In this paper, studies on extreme climate in China including extreme temperature and precipitation, dust weather activity, tropical cyclone activity, intense snowfall and cold surge activity, floods, and droughts are reviewed based on the peer-reviewed publications in recent decades. The review is focused first on the climatological features, variability, and trends in the past half century and then on simulations and projections based on global and regional climate models. As the annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increased throughout China, heat wave intensity and frequency overall increased in the past half century, with a large rate after the 1980s. The daily or yearly minimum SAT increased more significantly than the mean or maximum SAT. The long-term change in precipitation is predominantly characterized by the so-called southern flood and northern drought pattern in eastern China and by the overall increase over Northwest China. The interdecadal variation of monsoon, represented by the monsoon weakening in the end of 1970s, is largely responsible for this change in mean precipitation. Precipitation-related extreme events (e.g., heavy rainfall and intense snowfall) have become more frequent and intense generally over China in the recent years, with large spatial features. Dust weather activity, however, has become less frequent over northern China in the recent years, as result of weakened cold surge activity, reinforced precipitation, and improved vegetation condition. State-of-the-art climate models are capable of reproducing some features of the mean climate and extreme climate events. However, discrepancies among models in simulating and projecting the mean and extreme climate are also demonstrated by many recent studies. Regional models with higher resolutions often perform better than global models. To predict and project climate variations and extremes, many new approaches and schemes based on dynamical models, statistical methods, or their combinations have been developed, resulting in improved skills. With the improvements of climate model capability and resolution as well as our understanding of regional climate variability and extremes, these new approaches and techniques are expected to further improve the prediction and projection on regional climate variability and extremes over China in the future."
"Assessing environmental performance trends in the transport industry: Eco-innovation or catching-up? Abstract: This paper analyses the change in environmental performance that took place in the transport industry of 38 countries between the years 1995 and 2009. Data Envelopment Analysis techniques and directional distance functions are employed to compute Luenberger productivity indicators for the change in environmental performance and its determinants, namely, environmental technical change resulting from eco-innovation and catching-up with best available environmental technologies. Eight air pollutants account for the environmental contaminants from transport activities, and these are aggregated into three main categories of environmental pressures, namely, global warming, tropospheric ozone formation and acidification potentials. Furthermore, performance evaluation is based on how these specific environmental pressures are managed. Our principal findings show that there has been a noticeable improvement in environmental performance since the 1990s, primarily as a result of eco-innovations; moreover, this improvement has been markedly greater in low- and middle-income economies, bolstered, in this case, by both environmental technical progress and catching-up. These results reveal the need for policy measures aimed at encouraging catching-up with best available technologies, particularly in more developed countries."
"Fat-tailed risk about climate change and climate policy Abstract: This paper investigates the role of emissions control in welfare maximization under fat-tailed risk about climate change. We provide a classification of fat tails and discuss the effect of fat-tailed risk on climate policy. One of the main findings is that emissions control may prevent the “strong” tail-effect from arising, at least under some conditions such as bounded temperature increases, low risk aversion, low damage costs, and bounded utility function. More specifically, the fat-tailed risk with respect to a climate parameter does not necessarily lead to an unbounded carbon tax. In this case, the basic principle of cost-benefit analysis maintains its applicability."
"Global warming and the end-Permian extinction event: Proxy and modeling perspectives Abstract: The mass extinction event that occurred at the close of the Permian Period (~252million years ago) represents the most severe biodiversity loss in the ocean of the Phanerozoic. The links between the global carbon cycle, climate change and mass extinction are complex and involve a whole range of often inter-related geochemical, biological, ecologic and climatic factors. It has become widely accepted that the end-Permian mass extinction was associated with a global warming event, because the age of the Siberian Trap eruption, a potentially massive source of carbon dioxide, coincides within error with the extinction event. However, geologic data that are in support of this global warming event are relatively sparse. The chain of events and the causal relationship between the eruption of Siberian Traps and mass extinction is not well established. Global warming, in particular, has only been reported from limited proxy data and climate models, for which the pCO2 in the atmosphere just before and during the end-Permian extinction event is poorly known. This study critically assesses both the proxy climate data and the existing paleoclimate simulations with the goals of assessing our current understanding of the link between mass extinction and climate change and providing some guidance for future studies. Proxies indicate that prior to the end-Permian extinction event tropical sea surface temperatures ranged from ~22 to 25°C, and possible pCO2 values ranged from ~500 to ~4000ppm before the extinction event. During the peak extinction, tropical temperatures rose up to ~30°C while pCO2 perhaps increased up to ~8000ppm. Climate models that use different pre-event pCO2 values show similar amount of CO2 doubling to replicate the observed carbon isotope excursions. We find that the temperature anomaly during the end-Permian extinction is consistent with ~1.5 doublings of atmospheric pCO2, and that the implied climate sensitivity is 5–6°C, within the upper range of values produced by climate models."
"Epigenetic basis of sensitization to stress, affective episodes, and stimulants: implications for illness progression and prevention Objectives: The process of sensitization (increased responsivity) to the recurrence of stressors, affective episodes, and bouts of substance abuse that can drive illness progression in the recurrent affective disorders requires a memory of and increased reactivity to the prior exposures. A wealth of studies now supports the postulate that epigenetic mechanisms underlie both normal and pathological memory processes. Methods: We selectively reviewed the literature pertinent to the role of epigenetics in behavioral sensitization phenomena and discuss its clinical implications. Results: Epigenetics means above genetics and refers to environmental effects on the chemistry of DNA, histones (around which DNA is wound), and microRNA that change how easily genes are turned on and off. The evidence supports that sensitization to repeated stressor, affective episodes, and substance is likely based on epigenetic mechanisms and that these environmentally based processes can then become targets for prevention, early intervention, and ongoing treatment. Sensitization processes are remediable or preventable risk factors for a poor illness outcome and deserve increased clinical, public health, and research attention in the hopes of making the recurrent unipolar and bipolar affective disorders less impairing, disabling, and lethal by suicide and increased medical mortality. Conclusions: The findings that epigenetic chemical marks, which change in the most fundamental way how genes are regulated, mediate the long-term increased responsivity to recurrent stressors, mood episodes, and bouts of substance abuse should help change how the affective disorders are conceptualized and move treatment toward earlier, more comprehensive, and sustained pharmacoprophylaxis."
"Evaluation of CO2 absorption performance by molecular dynamic simulation for mixed secondary and tertiary amines Abstract: CO2 emission to the atmosphere is the most prominent cause of climate change and a major risk to environmental health. Although several techniques are very promising to reduce the CO2 emission from central emission points, the CO2 absorption by amines remains the most mature and reliable technology. Yet, there is more potential to improve absorption performance by choosing suitable solvents. Thus, the present research is intended to explore a better solvent combination for CO2 absorption by adopting the amine absorption process using molecular dynamic simulation. The study is designed to compare the intermolecular interactions of N[sbnd]C and N[sbnd]H bond between single 2EAE, DMAE (or 2DMAE), and blended solvent, i.e., 2EAE/PZ, 2DMAE/PZ with carbon dioxide and water and then to catch the effect of piperazine on these amines. The molecular dynamic simulations were performed by using the Material Studio application. The solvent concentration, 30 wt% under the condition of 313 K temperature at 0.1 MPa pressure, was taken for solvent systems. The results were interpreted by the Radial Distribution Function analysis. It was found that the blend of secondary and tertiary amines with piperazine 2EAE/PZ, DMAE/PZ reflect higher intermolecular interaction with CO2 as compared to single DMAE &amp; 2EAE. This finding shows that piperazine acts as a promoter on 2EAE and 2DMAE when interacting with CO2."
"An independent and combined effect analysis of land use and climate change in the upper Rhone River watershed, Switzerland Abstract: Land use and climate change play a significant role in hydrological processes. This study assesses the impact of land use and climate change in a snow and glacier dominated high altitude watershed, located in the southwestern part of Switzerland. Climate projections until the middle of the 21st century were analyzed using a Regional Climate Model from the IPCC A1B scenario. Land use maps were created using Idrisi TAIGA land change modeler, based on historical changes over two time periods and transformed for future forecasting. Logistic regression was used to generate these maps containing the probability of change between two different land use categories. Subsequently, the allocation of the land use was based on a multi-objective land distribution. The semi-distributed hydrological model called the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used for simulating streamflow. The analysis was done to assess the impact of streamflow in three time periods where 1981–2010 is considered as the observed period and the two other time periods from 2011 to 2025 and 2026–2050 are considered as the scenario periods. Flow Duration Curves (FDC) were generated to assess the impact of low and high streamflow periods. Our study shows a decrease in the summer peak flow and an early start of the melt driven peak flow. The major change observed in this study is the rising period of the hydrograph, i.e. in May and June an early shift is observed in the discharge. Independent analysis from land use change and climate change shows that the peak flow reduction occurs as a result of land use change, but the peak flow together with the timing of peak flow occurrence is also influenced by climatic change. The combined effect suggests a reduction of peak flow and early melt driven streamflow in the future. Information obtained from this study can be useful for water managers, especially for the hydropower based energy production sector in the Rhone watershed."
"Political, economic and environmental impacts of biofuels: A review Abstract: Current energy policies address environmental issues including environmentally friendly technologies to increase energy supplies and encourage cleaner, more efficient energy use, and address air pollution, greenhouse effect, global warming, and climate change. The biofuel policy aims to promote the use in transport of fuels made from biomass, as well as other renewable fuels. Biofuels provide the prospect of new economic opportunities for people in rural areas in oil importer and developing countries. The central policy of biofuel concerns job creation, greater efficiency in the general business environment, and protection of the environment. Projections are important tools for long-term planning and policy settings. Renewable energy sources that use indigenous resources have the potential to provide energy services with zero or almost zero emissions of both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Biofuels are expected to reduce dependence on imported petroleum with associated political and economic vulnerability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, and revitalize the economy by increasing demand and prices for agricultural products."
"Environmental impacts of micro-wind turbines and their potential to contribute to UK climate change targets Abstract: This paper evaluates the life cycle environmental sustainability of micro-wind turbines in the UK in comparison with grid electricity and solar PV (photovoltaics). The results suggests that per kWh electricity generated, the majority of environmental impacts from the wind turbines are lower than from grid electricity, ranging from 26% lower terrestrial toxicity to 92% lower global warming. However, depletion of abiotic elements, fresh-water and human toxicities are 82%, 74% and 53% higher than for grid electricity, respectively. The wind turbines are more environmentally sustainable than solar PV for seven out of 11 impacts, ranging from 7.5% lower eutrophication to 85% lower ozone layer depletion. However, depletion of fossil resources, fresh-water, human and terrestrial toxicities are higher for the wind turbine than for the PV, ranging from 5% for the former to 87% for the latter. UK-wide deployment of micro-wind turbines would save between 0.6 and 1% of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions on 2009 levels. Therefore, the potential of micro-wind turbines to contribute towards UK's climate change targets is limited."
"A new model to assess the environmental impact and sustainability of energy systems Abstract: This study develops a novel sustainability assessment methodology for energy systems using life-cycle emission factors and sustainability indicators. Here, the global warming and environmental impact dimensions of the sustainability assessment methodology are examined in detail. A comparative analysis shows that a wind-battery system produces fewer potential global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, air pollution, and water pollution impacts compared to a gas-fired system. The wind-battery system generates 13% of the life-cycle GHG emissions and 22% of the life-cycle ozone-depleting substance emissions of a gas-fired power plant. Nitrous oxide contributes more than 90% of the stratospheric ozone depletion potential of gas-fired and wind-battery systems."
"Climatic physical snowpack properties for large-scale modeling examined by observations and a physical model Abstract: Here we have conducted an integral study using site observations and a model with detailed snow dynamics, to examine the capability of the model for deriving a simple relationship between the density and thermal conductivity of the snowpack within different climatic zones used in large-scale climate modeling. Snow and meteorological observations were conducted at multiple sites in different climatic regions (two in Interior Alaska, two in Japan). A series of thermal conductivity measurements in snow pit observations done in Alaska provided useful information for constructing the relationship. The one-dimensional snow dynamics model, SNOWPACK, simulated the evolution of the snowpack and compared observations between all sites. Overall, model simulations tended to underestimate the density and overestimate the thermal conductivity, and failed to foster the relationship evident in the observations from the current and previous research. The causes for the deficiency were analyzed and discussed, regarding a low density of the new snow layer and a slow compaction rate. Our working relationships were compared to the equations derived by previous investigators. Discrepancy from the regression for the melting season observations in Alaska was found in common."
"Empirical determinants of eco-innovation in European countries using the community innovation survey Abstract: The determinants of eco-innovation activities have been widely explored for single countries. However, there is a lack of analyses comparing different countries. The Community Innovation Survey (CIS 2008) allows for an analysis of the determinants of eco-innovation in 19 different European countries. This paper focuses on Eastern Europe as the determinants of eco-innovation have not yet been systematically analyzed for these countries. Concerning the introduction of eco-innovations, this analysis shows that regulation activities and environmentally related subsidies seem to be more important for the Eastern countries than they are for the “richer” Western European countries. Furthermore, the Eastern European countries rely more on competitors and external R&D as information sources, indicating a technology transfer from West to East."
